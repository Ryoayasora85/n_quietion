      "\n",
      "1. Responsibility: If we issue a card, you agree to repay all amounts \n",
      "advanced to you, any fees or charges and the FINANCE CHARGE arising from \n",
      "the use of the card and the card account. For example, you are responsible for \n",

      "continues even though an agreement, divorce decree or other court judgments \n",
      "to which we are not a party may direct you or one of the other persons \n",
      "responsible to pay the account.\n",

      "is less than $25 plus (c) any portion of the Minimum Payment(s) shown on prior \n",
      "statement(s) which remains unpaid. In addition, at any time your Total New \n",

      "paying the full amount of the New Balance Total each month within 25 days of \n",
      "your statement closing date. Otherwise, the New Balance, including purchases, \n",

The word “PIN” means Personal Identification \\nNumber issued by us for use to access the VISA Line of Credit “Account” with us. “We”, “us”, “our” and “ANDREWS FEDERAL” mean Andrews Federal \\nCredit Union. “VISA Check” means the VISA checks we issue to access the VISA Line of Credit account with us. \\n \\n\\n1. ACCEPTANCE OF CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND USE OF CARD AND VISA CHECKS. When you accept or use our Card or VISA Checks, or if \\nyou use a Card or VISA Check issued under an Account we hold, you agree to the terms in this Agreement. You must sign your Card before you can \\nuse it. All Cards issued to you remain our property and must be returned to us upon request. You may use your Card to purchase or lease goods or to \\npurchase services (“Purchases”) from a participating VISA plan merchant. You may also obtain loans (“Cash Advances”) from us or any financial \\ninstitution that accepts the Card. To make a Purchase or obtain a Cash Advance, you may use any of the following procedures. First, you may present \\nthe Card to a participating VISA plan merchant, to us, or to another financial institution, and sign the sales or Cash Advance draft which will be imprinted \\nwith your Card or part or all of your Card number. As an alternative, you may complete the transaction by using your Personal Identification Number \\n(PIN) when required in conjunction with the Card in an Automated Teller Machine or other type of electronic terminal that provides access to the VISA \\nsystem. You may transfer balances from other creditors by contacting us. You also may use VISA Checks that we may issue to you. You may use the \\nVISA Checks to obtain a Cash Advance or make Purchases up to your available Credit Line. VISA Checks may be used like any other check; however, \\nyou agree not to make any payment on your Account with a VISA Check. All VISA Checks will be treated as Cash Advances for the purpose of \\ncomputing FINANCE CHARGES.  \\n\\nYour Account may be used for lawful transactions only. You agree that use of your Card and/or VISA Checks for illegal transactions (including, \\nbut not limited to, unlawful gambling) will be deemed a default and/or breach of this Agreement and may result in the termination of your Account and \\nother actions stated in the “Default” provisions of this Agreement.  \\n\\nIf you use your Account for illegal transactions, you waive any right to sue ANDREWS FEDERAL for such illegal transactions or any activity \\ndirectly or indirectly related to it. Additionally, you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any suits or other legal action or liability, directly or \\nindirectly, relating from such illegal transactions.  \\n2. RESPONSIBILITY. You promise to pay us the total amount of each Purchase and Cash Advance resulting from the use of the Card, VISA Checks, or \\nyour Account, plus any finance charge and other charges due under the terms of this Agreement. All payments must be made in U.S. Dollars and \\ndelivered or mailed to us at the address shown on your periodic statement. For example, you are responsible for charges made by yourself, as well as \\ncharges made by joint users. You are also responsible for charges made by anyone else to whom you give the Card and/or VISA Check, and this \\nresponsibility continues until you recover the Card and/or VISA Check and all charges are paid. Your obligations to pay the Account balance continue \\neven though an agreement, divorce decree, or other court judgment to which we are not a party, may direct a joint user or any other person responsible \\nunder this Agreement to pay the Account. Any person using the Card and/or VISA Check is jointly and severally responsible with you for charges he or \\nshe makes, but if that person signs a Card he or she becomes a party to this Agreement and is also jointly and severally responsible for all charges on \\nthe Account, including yours.  \\n3. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE. As provided from time to time in VISA’s Operation Regulations, when a transaction is processed through the \\nVISA network, you will not be liable for unauthorized use of your Card or VISA checks unless you were grossly negligent in the handling of your Account \\nor Card. You may be liable for unauthorized use of your Card or VISA Checks when the transaction is not processed through the VISA network, like at \\nATMs or other non-VISA branded transactions when a PIN is required and in all cases when you were grossly negligent in the handling of your Account \\nor Card but in any event, your liability will not exceed $50.00. Also, you will not be liable for unauthorized use of your Card or VISA Checks that occurs \\nafter you notify us by telephone or in writing as indicated below. In all cases, immediately upon learning of the loss, theft or possible unauthorized use of \\nyour Card and/or VISA Checks, you agree to notify us by calling 1-800-449-7728 during regular business hours, weekends, holidays, or after Credit \\nUnion hours; or by writing to: Andrews Federal Credit Union, 5711 Allentown Road, Suitland, Maryland 20746 (Attention: Operations Department). You \\nagree to give us your complete cooperation in our efforts to recover any stolen Card and/or VISA Check and amounts due from unauthorized users and \\nto have unauthorized users prosecuted.  \\n4. CREDIT LINE. Upon approval of your application, a self-replenishing Line of Credit will be established for you up to the enclosed credit limit. You \\nagree not to let the Account balance exceed this approved Credit Line. Each payment you make on the Account will restore your Credit Line by the \\namount of the payment which is applied to the principal. You may request an increase in your Credit Line by application to us, which must be approved \\nby us. By giving you written notice, we may reduce your Credit Line from time to time. We can honor Purchases or Cash Advances in excess of your \\napproved Credit Line at any time, but the decision is up to us. If we do so, this Agreement will cover those Purchases and Cash Advances and you \\nagree to pay us the amount in excess of your approved Credit Line immediately. If you write a VISA Check that would exceed your approved Credit Line, \\nwe either may return the check to the payee without payment or honor the check and demand payment from you of the excess amount. When \\ndemanded, you immediately will repay the excess amount. You agree that we are not liable to you for any VISA Check returned.  \\n5. CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT. You may close your Account any time in person, by telephone or by notifying us in writing. Notice by any one of you is \\neffective to close your Account for all of you. If you close your Account, you will still be required to pay any amounts you owe us, including Purchases, \\nother charges, and Cash Advances that have not been billed to you yet. If someone else is authorized to use your Account and you want to end that \\nperson’s privilege, you must let us know in writing and we have a reasonable opportunity to act on that notice before transactions by that person shall be \\ndeemed “unauthorized.” If he or she has a Card or VISA Check, you must return the Card and VISA Checks with your written notice. If you are unable to \\nreturn that person’s Card and VISA Checks, we will close the Account and both you and the authorized user of your Account may apply for a new \\nAccount. If we close the Account, you and the authorized user will still be liable, individually and together, for all amounts charged to your Account.  \\n\\nExcept where specific notice is required by law, we can cancel your Account any time by telephone or by writing to you at the address shown \\non our billing records. You will still be required to pay any amounts you owe us, including Purchases, other charges, and Cash Advances that have not \\nbeen billed to you yet. You are also required to return all Cards and VISA Checks to us.  \\n6. CREDIT INFORMATION. You authorize us to investigate your credit starting when opening, renewing, or reviewing your Account, and you authorize \\nus to disclose information regarding your Account to credit bureaus and other creditors who inquire of us about your credit standing to the extent \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nauthorized in our bylaws or by federal or state law. You will furnish us promptly on request from time to time updated information regarding your financial \\ncondition.  \\n7. MONTHLY PAYMENT. We will mail you a statement every month showing your Minimum Payment required. Every month you must pay at least the \\nMinimum Payment within 25 days of your statement closing date. You may of course, pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment, or pay \\nthe Total New Balance in full, and you will reduce or eliminate the FINANCE CHARGE by doing so. On a Visa Platinum Premier and Visa Signature \\nCard, the Minimum Payment will be either (a) 2% of your Total New Balance, or $15.00, whichever is greater, or (b) your Total New Balance, if it is less \\nthan $15.00. On a Visa Platinum Basic or Visa Platinum Secured card, the Minimum Payment will be either (a) 3% of your Total New Balance, or \\n$15.00, whichever is greater, or (b) your Total New Balance if it is less than $15.00. The Minimum Payment will be rounded off to the next whole dollar.  \\n\\nPayments made to your Account will be applied in the following order: Payments in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be applied in \\naccordance with the law and payments equal to or less than the Minimum Payment Due will be applied at our discretion.  All communications to \\nANDREWS FEDERAL concerning disputed debts, including a check or other instrument sent by you in full satisfaction of your indebtedness, must be \\nsent to: Andrews Federal Credit Union, 5711 Allentown Road, Suitland, Maryland 20746 (Attention: Operations Department). For ACH (automatic \\nclearing house) payment in full, the payoff balance is calculated on the previous month’s ending balance less current cycle payments.  \\n8. FINANCE CHARGES ON PURCHASES. No FINANCE CHARGE will be charged on Purchases if you pay the entire New Balance of Purchases each \\nmonth within 25 days of your statement closing date. Otherwise, the amount of any Purchase will bear FINANCE CHARGES from the date it is posted to \\nyour Account.  \\n\\nOn each billing date, we figure the FINANCE CHARGE on your Purchases by applying the “Current Monthly Periodic Rate” to the “Average \\nDaily Purchases Balance.” To get the Average Daily Purchases Balance we take the beginning Purchases Balance each day, subtract any payments or \\ncredits, and add new Purchases and other charges provided for in this Agreement. We do not include unpaid FINANCE CHARGES. This gives us the \\n“Daily Purchases Balance.” Then, we add all the Daily Purchases Balances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the \\nbilling cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Purchases Balance.  \\n9. FINANCE CHARGES ON CASH ADVANCES. On each billing date, we figure the FINANCE CHARGE on your Cash Advances by applying the \\nCurrent Monthly Periodic Rate to the “Average Daily Cash Advance Balance.” A Cash Advance will bear FINANCE CHARGES from the transaction date. \\nTo get the Average Daily Cash Advance Balance, we take the beginning Cash Advance Balance each day, add new advances and subtract any \\npayments or credits. We do not include unpaid FINANCE CHARGES. This gives us the Daily Cash Advance Balance. Then, we add together all the \\nDaily Cash Advance Balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Cash \\nAdvance Balance.  \\n10. FINANCE CHARGES. On Visa Platinum Premier, Visa Signature or Basic, the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) will increase or decrease as \\nthe Prime Rate (as defined below) in effect on the 1st of December each year (the Index) increases or decreases.  Any increase or decrease in the \\nIndex and resulting change to your ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will be effective as of the 1st day of your next billing cycle and will apply: (a) to all \\nPurchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances made on or after the effective date and (b) to any prior account balance outstanding as of the \\neffective date.  In this way, the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will not increase more than once a year. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (the \\nstandard rate) for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances are shown on the enclosed Credit and Fee Disclosure that is part of this Agreement.  \\nFor Visa Platinum Premier, this standard rate is determined by adding a margin of 4.74%, 8.74% or 11.74% to the Index. For Visa Signature, this \\nstandard rate is determined by adding a margin of 2.74% to the Index. For Visa Platinum Basic, this standard rate is determined by adding a margin of \\n18.0% to the Index.  The rate on the account will not exceed 18.0% APR.  Each increase and decrease may have the effect of increasing or decreasing \\nyour Minimum Payment. \\n\\n On Visa Platinum Secured, the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will increase or decrease as the Prime Rate (as defined below) in effect on the \\n15th of December, March, June and September each year (the Index) increases or decreases.  Any increase or decrease in the Index and resulting \\nchange to your ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will be effective as of the  1st day of your new billing cycle in the month immediately following a change \\nin the Index (that is, as of the 1st day of your new billing cycle that begins in January, April, July and October (called, respectively the “Effective Date”)) \\nand will apply: (a) to all Purchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances made on or after the effective date and (b) to any prior account balance \\noutstanding as of the effective date.  In this way, the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will not increase more than four times a year. The ANNUAL \\nPERCENTAGE RATE (the standard rate) for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances are shown on the enclosed Credit and Fee Disclosure \\nthat is part of this Agreement.  For Visa Platinum Secured this standard rate is determined by adding a margin of 11.25% to the Index.  The rate on the \\naccount will not exceed 18.0% APR. Each increase and decrease may have the effect of increasing or decreasing your Minimum Payment. \\n\\n As used in this Agreement, the “Prime Rate” in effect on any day is the per annum rate reported at large U.S. money center commercial banks \\nin The Wall Street Journal in its Money Rates section, a compilation of key United States and foreign annual interest rates.   If more than one Prime Rate \\nis reported, the highest rate reported shall be the Prime Rate.  If no Prime Rate is reported on such day, the Prime Rate is the per annum rate next \\nreported after such day as the Prime Rate at large U.S. money center commercial banks in The Wall Street Journal’s Money Rates section.  The Index is \\navailable to you and verifiable by you at any of our offices.  If the Index becomes unavailable, we may, at our option, choose another Index, made readily \\navailable to and verifiable by you and beyond our control, and change the Margin used.  If this happens, the substitute Index will, for the purposes of this \\nAgreement, be considered to be the “Index”. FINANCE CHARGES shall continue to accrue at the foregoing rates until you pay your Account as \\ndescribed above or we get a judgment against you and are required by law to charge a lower rate. \\n11. FEES. You agree to pay certain fees in connection with your Account as shown on the enclosed Credit and Fee Disclosure that is part of this \\nAgreement. These fees may be added to your Account as a Purchase when they are imposed.  \\n12. DEFAULT. In addition to other events of default stated in the Agreement, you will be in default of this Agreement if (i) you do not make any required \\npayment by the date it is due, or if you fail to comply with or perform any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of this Agreement; (ii) you begin, or any \\nother person puts you in, a bankruptcy, insolvency, or receivership proceeding; (iii) you have furnished to us any credit information that is materially \\nincorrect in any respect; (iv) you attempt to make Purchases or Cash Advances in excess of your credit limit without our permission; (v) become \\nincompetent or die; or (vi) if you fail to perform on any other agreements with us. We have the right to demand immediate payment of your full Account \\nbalance if you default, subject to our giving you any notice required by law. Unless prohibited by law, you will also be required to pay our collection \\nexpenses, including court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. Our failure to exercise any of our rights when you default does not mean that we are \\nunable to use those rights later with regard to that or another default. We can accept late payments or partial payments without losing any of our rights \\nunder this Agreement.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n13. NOTICES. Notice sent to any one of you will be considered notice to all. Any notices we give you shall be in writing and deemed given when \\ndeposited in the U.S. mail, with postage prepaid and addressed to you at your last known address in our records for your Account or when sent by e-\\nmail (if you use our Internet banking services) to your last known internet address. Your notices to us must be in writing and sent to the address shown \\nin your most recent billing statement or as otherwise specified in this Agreement. If a specific notice period or type of notice is required by applicable law, \\nthe notice will be made and will be binding in accordance with such law.  \\n14. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS. Purchases and cash advances made in foreign countries and foreign currencies will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. \\nThe exchange rate for transactions in a foreign currency will be a rate selected by VISA from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets \\nfor the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate VISA itself receives, or the government mandated rate in effect for the \\napplicable central processing date, in either case, plus 1% of the amount of the foreign currency purchase or cash advance after its conversion into U.S. \\ndollars. The exchange rate in effect on the central processing date may differ from the rate in effect on either the transaction date or the posting date. \\nThe exchange rate is subject to change by VISA.  \\n15. TELEPHONE MONITORING. To ensure that you received accurate and courteous customer service, on occasion, your call may be monitored by \\nour employees or agents and you agree to any such monitoring.  \\n16. PLAN MERCHANT DISPUTES. We are not liable for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution to honor your Card and/or VISA Check. \\n17. SECURITY. Pursuant to the Credit Card Application, you grant Andrews Federal Credit Union (“Andrews FCU”), on any credit extended or cash \\nadvanced under this credit card account, a security interest in any and all of your Andrews FCU share accounts, deposits, and payments (collectively \\nreferred to as “SHARE ACCOUNTS”), whether held jointly or individually, up to the amount of your outstanding credit card account balance. Further, you \\ngive express consent to enable Andrews FCU to include any otherwise statutorily protected funds that may not otherwise be available by legal process, \\nto liquidate any Andrews FCU indebtedness, owed by you or any person who is listed as a joint owner on your credit card accounts with Andrews FCU, \\nincluding a deceased joint owner. Andrews FCU may take such action without further notice to you or any joint owner. In regard to those funds that have \\na statutory protection you understand that you may withdraw your express consent for Andrews FCU to apply such funds to pay any such indebtedness \\nby notifying Andrews FCU in writing. If your consent is withdrawn, Andrews FCU may in its sole discretion terminate any and all services that you have \\nwith Andrews FCU. In addition, the conditions of the Credit Card Application are incorporated into the terms of this Agreement.  \\n18. BILLING ADDRESS. If your Account is a joint account or if more than one person is permitted to use the Account, you agree that all notices \\nregarding the Account may be sent solely to the address shown on our billing records. You agree to give us written notice of any change in your billing \\naddress. You may do this when you mail us a payment or you may send the notice to us in a separate letter.  \\n19. EFFECT OF AGREEMENT AND AMENDMENTS. This Agreement governs all transactions on your Account even though the sales, Cash Advance, \\ncredit, or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms. We may amend the terms of this Agreement at any time. If we do so, we will notify \\nyou in writing in accordance with applicable law. Except as limited by applicable law, any amendment will apply to all then outstanding unpaid \\nindebtedness on your Account prior to the effective date of the amendment. Any such amendment will not require your written consent, and will become \\neffective as stated in the notice, but your consent (if required by applicable law) may be evidenced by your use of the Card or VISA Check after we give \\nyou notice of the amendment. We may at any time add new credit services, discontinue any credit services, or replace your Card and/or VISA Checks \\nwith others. We extend credit under Subtitle 9 of Title 12 of the Commercial Law Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland except to the extent pre-\\nempted by federal law. This Agreement is governed by the internal laws of Maryland and federal law. \\n20. VISA PLATINUM and VISA SIGNATURE REWARD CARD POINTS. Earned points will expire at the end of four years. \\n \\n\\nYOUR BILLING RIGHTS \\nKEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE \\n\\nThis notice contains important information about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. \\n \\n\\nNOTIFY US IN CASE OF ERRORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR BILL \\nIf you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet at the address listed on your \\nbill. Write to us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. \\nYou can telephone us at 1-800-654-7728, but doing so will not preserve your rights.  \\nIn your letter, give us the following information:  \\n•  Your name and account number.  \\n•  The dollar amount of the suspected error.  \\n•  Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are not sure about.  \\nIf you have authorized us to pay your credit card bill automatically from your savings or share draft account, you can stop payment on any amount you \\nthink is wrong. To stop the payment your letter must reach us three business days before the automatic payment is scheduled to occur.  \\n \\n\\nYOUR RIGHTS AND OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AFTER WE RECEIVE YOUR WRITTEN NOTICE \\nWe must acknowledge your letter within 30 days, unless we have corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, we must either correct the error or explain \\nwhy we believe the bill was correct.  \\nAfter we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question, or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill you for the amount \\nyou question, including finance charges, and we can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. You do not have to pay any questioned amount \\nwhile we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question.  \\nIf we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay any finance charges related to any questioned amount. If we did not make a \\nmistake, you may have to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will \\nsend you a statement of the amount you owe and the date that it is due.  \\n\\n\\n\\n M-113506 \\n \\n\\nIf you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to \\nus within ten days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill. And, we must tell \\nyou the name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is.  \\nIf we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct.  \\n \\n\\nSPECIAL RULE FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES \\nIf you have a problem with the quality of property or services that you purchased with a credit card and you have tried in good faith to correct the \\nproblem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the property or services. There are two limitations on this \\nright:  \\n(a) You must have made the purchase in your home state or, if not within your home state, within 100 miles of your current mailing address; and  \\n(b) The purchase price must have been more than $50.  \\nThese limitations do not apply if we own or operate the merchant, or if we mailed you the advertisement for the property or services. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n TITANIUM VISA SIGNATURE CREDIT CARD \\nCREDIT & FEE DISCLOSURE (VARIABLE RATE) \\n\\n \\n\\nEffective Date: January 1, 2016 \\n\\nInterest Rate and Interest Charges \\n\\n \\nFees \\n\\n \\nHow We Will Calculate Your Balance:  We use a method called “average daily balance” (including new \\npurchases).

When you accept or use our Card or VISA Checks, or if \\nyou use a Card or VISA Check issued under an Account we hold, you agree to the terms in this Agreement. You must sign your Card before you can \\nuse it. All Cards issued to you remain our property and must be returned to us upon request. You may use your Card to purchase or lease goods or to \\npurchase services (“Purchases”) from a participating VISA plan merchant. You may also obtain loans (“Cash Advances”) from us or any financial \\ninstitution that accepts the Card. To make a Purchase or obtain a Cash Advance, you may use any of the following procedures. First, you may present \\nthe Card to a participating VISA plan merchant, to us, or to another financial institution, and sign the sales or Cash Advance draft which will be imprinted \\nwith your Card or part or all of your Card number. As an alternative, you may complete the transaction by using your Personal Identification Number \\n(PIN) when required in conjunction with the Card in an Automated Teller Machine or other type of electronic terminal that provides access to the VISA \\nsystem. You may transfer balances from other creditors by contacting us. You also may use VISA Checks that we may issue to you. You may use the \\nVISA Checks to obtain a Cash Advance or make Purchases up to your available Credit Line. VISA Checks may be used like any other check; however, \\nyou agree not to make any payment on your Account with a VISA Check. All VISA Checks will be treated as Cash Advances for the purpose of \\ncomputing FINANCE CHARGES.  \\n\\nYour Account may be used for lawful transactions only. You agree that use of your Card and/or VISA Checks for illegal transactions (including, \\nbut not limited to, unlawful gambling) will be deemed a default and/or breach of this Agreement and may result in the termination of your Account and \\nother actions stated in the “Default” provisions of this Agreement.  \\n\\nIf you use your Account for illegal transactions, you waive any right to sue ANDREWS FEDERAL for such illegal transactions or any activity \\ndirectly or indirectly related to it. Additionally, you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any suits or other legal action or liability, directly or \\nindirectly, relating from such illegal transactions.  \\n2. RESPONSIBILITY. You promise to pay us the total amount of each Purchase and Cash Advance resulting from the use of the Card, VISA Checks, or \\nyour Account, plus any finance charge and other charges due under the terms of this Agreement. All payments must be made in U.S. Dollars and \\ndelivered or mailed to us at the address shown on your periodic statement. For example, you are responsible for charges made by yourself, as well as \\ncharges made by joint users. You are also responsible for charges made by anyone else to whom you give the Card and/or VISA Check, and this \\nresponsibility continues until you recover the Card and/or VISA Check and all charges are paid. Your obligations to pay the Account balance continue \\neven though an agreement, divorce decree, or other court judgment to which we are not a party, may direct a joint user or any other person responsible \\nunder this Agreement to pay the Account. Any person using the Card and/or VISA Check is jointly and severally responsible with you for charges he or \\nshe makes, but if that person signs a Card he or she becomes a party to this Agreement and is also jointly and severally responsible for all charges on \\nthe Account, including yours.  \\n3. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE. As provided from time to time in VISA’s Operation Regulations, when a transaction is processed through the \\nVISA network, you will not be liable for unauthorized use of your Card or VISA checks unless you were grossly negligent in the handling of your Account \\nor Card. You may be liable for unauthorized use of your Card or VISA Checks when the transaction is not processed through the VISA network, like at \\nATMs or other non-VISA branded transactions when a PIN is required and in all cases when you were grossly negligent in the handling of your Account \\nor Card but in any event, your liability will not exceed $50.00. Also, you will not be liable for unauthorized use of your Card or VISA Checks that occurs \\nafter you notify us by telephone or in writing as indicated below. In all cases, immediately upon learning of the loss, theft or possible unauthorized use of \\nyour Card and/or VISA Checks, you agree to notify us by calling 1-800-449-7728 during regular business hours, weekends, holidays, or after Credit \\nUnion hours; or by writing to: Andrews Federal Credit Union, 5711 Allentown Road, Suitland, Maryland 20746 (Attention: Operations Department). You \\nagree to give us your complete cooperation in our efforts to recover any stolen Card and/or VISA Check and amounts due from unauthorized users and \\nto have unauthorized users prosecuted.  \\n4. CREDIT LINE. Upon approval of your application, a self-replenishing Line of Credit will be established for you up to the enclosed credit limit. You \\nagree not to let the Account balance exceed this approved Credit Line. Each payment you make on the Account will restore your Credit Line by the \\namount of the payment which is applied to the principal. You may request an increase in your Credit Line by application to us, which must be approved \\nby us. By giving you written notice, we may reduce your Credit Line from time to time. We can honor Purchases or Cash Advances in excess of your \\napproved Credit Line at any time, but the decision is up to us. If we do so, this Agreement will cover those Purchases and Cash Advances and you \\nagree to pay us the amount in excess of your approved Credit Line immediately. If you write a VISA Check that would exceed your approved Credit Line, \\nwe either may return the check to the payee without payment or honor the check and demand payment from you of the excess amount. When \\ndemanded, you immediately will repay the excess amount. You agree that we are not liable to you for any VISA Check returned.  \\n5. CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT. You may close your Account any time in person, by telephone or by notifying us in writing. Notice by any one of you is \\neffective to close your Account for all of you. If you close your Account, you will still be required to pay any amounts you owe us, including Purchases, \\nother charges, and Cash Advances that have not been billed to you yet. If someone else is authorized to use your Account and you want to end that \\nperson’s privilege, you must let us know in writing and we have a reasonable opportunity to act on that notice before transactions by that person shall be \\ndeemed “unauthorized.” If he or she has a Card or VISA Check, you must return the Card and VISA Checks with your written notice. If you are unable to \\nreturn that person’s Card and VISA Checks, we will close the Account and both you and the authorized user of your Account may apply for a new \\nAccount. If we close the Account, you and the authorized user will still be liable, individually and together, for all amounts charged to your Account.  \\n\\nExcept where specific notice is required by law, we can cancel your Account any time by telephone or by writing to you at the address shown \\non our billing records. You will still be required to pay any amounts you owe us, including Purchases, other charges, and Cash Advances that have not \\nbeen billed to you yet. You are also required to return all Cards and VISA Checks to us.  \\n6. CREDIT INFORMATION. You authorize us to investigate your credit starting when opening, renewing, or reviewing your Account, and you authorize \\nus to disclose information regarding your Account to credit bureaus and other creditors who inquire of us about your credit standing to the extent \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nauthorized in our bylaws or by federal or state law. You will furnish us promptly on request from time to time updated information regarding your financial \\ncondition.  \\n7. MONTHLY PAYMENT. We will mail you a statement every month showing your Minimum Payment required. Every month you must pay at least the \\nMinimum Payment within 25 days of your statement closing date. You may of course, pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment, or pay \\nthe Total New Balance in full, and you will reduce or eliminate the FINANCE CHARGE by doing so. On a Visa Platinum Premier and Visa Signature \\nCard, the Minimum Payment will be either (a) 2% of your Total New Balance, or $15.00, whichever is greater, or (b) your Total New Balance, if it is less \\nthan $15.00. On a Visa Platinum Basic or Visa Platinum Secured card, the Minimum Payment will be either (a) 3% of your Total New Balance, or \\n$15.00, whichever is greater, or (b) your Total New Balance if it is less than $15.00. The Minimum Payment will be rounded off to the next whole dollar.  \\n\\nPayments made to your Account will be applied in the following order: Payments in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be applied in \\naccordance with the law and payments equal to or less than the Minimum Payment Due will be applied at our discretion.  All communications to \\nANDREWS FEDERAL concerning disputed debts, including a check or other instrument sent by you in full satisfaction of your indebtedness, must be \\nsent to: Andrews Federal Credit Union, 5711 Allentown Road, Suitland, Maryland 20746 (Attention: Operations Department). For ACH (automatic \\nclearing house) payment in full, the payoff balance is calculated on the previous month’s ending balance less current cycle payments.  \\n8. FINANCE CHARGES ON PURCHASES. No FINANCE CHARGE will be charged on Purchases if you pay the entire New Balance of Purchases each \\nmonth within 25 days of your statement closing date. Otherwise, the amount of any Purchase will bear FINANCE CHARGES from the date it is posted to \\nyour Account.  \\n\\nOn each billing date, we figure the FINANCE CHARGE on your Purchases by applying the “Current Monthly Periodic Rate” to the “Average \\nDaily Purchases Balance.” To get the Average Daily Purchases Balance we take the beginning Purchases Balance each day, subtract any payments or \\ncredits, and add new Purchases and other charges provided for in this Agreement. We do not include unpaid FINANCE CHARGES. This gives us the \\n“Daily Purchases Balance.” Then, we add all the Daily Purchases Balances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the \\nbilling cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Purchases Balance.  \\n9. FINANCE CHARGES ON CASH ADVANCES. On each billing date, we figure the FINANCE CHARGE on your Cash Advances by applying the \\nCurrent Monthly Periodic Rate to the “Average Daily Cash Advance Balance.” A Cash Advance will bear FINANCE CHARGES from the transaction date. \\nTo get the Average Daily Cash Advance Balance, we take the beginning Cash Advance Balance each day, add new advances and subtract any \\npayments or credits. We do not include unpaid FINANCE CHARGES. This gives us the Daily Cash Advance Balance. Then, we add together all the \\nDaily Cash Advance Balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Cash \\nAdvance Balance.  \\n10. FINANCE CHARGES. On Visa Platinum Premier, Visa Signature or Basic, the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) will increase or decrease as \\nthe Prime Rate (as defined below) in effect on the 1st of December each year (the Index) increases or decreases.  Any increase or decrease in the \\nIndex and resulting change to your ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will be effective as of the 1st day of your next billing cycle and will apply: (a) to all \\nPurchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances made on or after the effective date and (b) to any prior account balance outstanding as of the \\neffective date.  In this way, the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will not increase more than once a year. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (the \\nstandard rate) for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances are shown on the enclosed Credit and Fee Disclosure that is part of this Agreement.  \\nFor Visa Platinum Premier, this standard rate is determined by adding a margin of 4.74%, 8.74% or 11.74% to the Index. For Visa Signature, this \\nstandard rate is determined by adding a margin of 2.74% to the Index. For Visa Platinum Basic, this standard rate is determined by adding a margin of \\n18.0% to the Index.  The rate on the account will not exceed 18.0% APR.  Each increase and decrease may have the effect of increasing or decreasing \\nyour Minimum Payment. \\n\\n On Visa Platinum Secured, the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will increase or decrease as the Prime Rate (as defined below) in effect on the \\n15th of December, March, June and September each year (the Index) increases or decreases.  Any increase or decrease in the Index and resulting \\nchange to your ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will be effective as of the  1st day of your new billing cycle in the month immediately following a change \\nin the Index (that is, as of the 1st day of your new billing cycle that begins in January, April, July and October (called, respectively the “Effective Date”)) \\nand will apply: (a) to all Purchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances made on or after the effective date and (b) to any prior account balance \\noutstanding as of the effective date.  In this way, the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will not increase more than four times a year. The ANNUAL \\nPERCENTAGE RATE (the standard rate) for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances are shown on the enclosed Credit and Fee Disclosure \\nthat is part of this Agreement.  For Visa Platinum Secured this standard rate is determined by adding a margin of 11.25% to the Index.  The rate on the \\naccount will not exceed 18.0% APR. Each increase and decrease may have the effect of increasing or decreasing your Minimum Payment. \\n\\n As used in this Agreement, the “Prime Rate” in effect on any day is the per annum rate reported at large U.S. money center commercial banks \\nin The Wall Street Journal in its Money Rates section, a compilation of key United States and foreign annual interest rates.   If more than one Prime Rate \\nis reported, the highest rate reported shall be the Prime Rate.  If no Prime Rate is reported on such day, the Prime Rate is the per annum rate next \\nreported after such day as the Prime Rate at large U.S. money center commercial banks in The Wall Street Journal’s Money Rates section.  The Index is \\navailable to you and verifiable by you at any of our offices.  If the Index becomes unavailable, we may, at our option, choose another Index, made readily \\navailable to and verifiable by you and beyond our control, and change the Margin used.  If this happens, the substitute Index will, for the purposes of this \\nAgreement, be considered to be the “Index”. FINANCE CHARGES shall continue to accrue at the foregoing rates until you pay your Account as \\ndescribed above or we get a judgment against you and are required by law to charge a lower rate. \\n11. FEES. You agree to pay certain fees in connection with your Account as shown on the enclosed Credit and Fee Disclosure that is part of this \\nAgreement. These fees may be added to your Account as a Purchase when they are imposed.  \\n12. DEFAULT. In addition to other events of default stated in the Agreement, you will be in default of this Agreement if (i) you do not make any required \\npayment by the date it is due, or if you fail to comply with or perform any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of this Agreement; (ii) you begin, or any \\nother person puts you in, a bankruptcy, insolvency, or receivership proceeding; (iii) you have furnished to us any credit information that is materially \\nincorrect in any respect; (iv) you attempt to make Purchases or Cash Advances in excess of your credit limit without our permission; (v) become \\nincompetent or die; or (vi) if you fail to perform on any other agreements with us. We have the right to demand immediate payment of your full Account \\nbalance if you default, subject to our giving you any notice required by law. Unless prohibited by law, you will also be required to pay our collection \\nexpenses, including court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. Our failure to exercise any of our rights when you default does not mean that we are \\nunable to use those rights later with regard to that or another default. We can accept late payments or partial payments without losing any of our rights \\nunder this Agreement.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n13. NOTICES. Notice sent to any one of you will be considered notice to all. Any notices we give you shall be in writing and deemed given when \\ndeposited in the U.S. mail, with postage prepaid and addressed to you at your last known address in our records for your Account or when sent by e-\\nmail (if you use our Internet banking services) to your last known internet address. Your notices to us must be in writing and sent to the address shown \\nin your most recent billing statement or as otherwise specified in this Agreement. If a specific notice period or type of notice is required by applicable law, \\nthe notice will be made and will be binding in accordance with such law.  \\n14. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS. Purchases and cash advances made in foreign countries and foreign currencies will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. \\nThe exchange rate for transactions in a foreign currency will be a rate selected by VISA from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets \\nfor the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate VISA itself receives, or the government mandated rate in effect for the \\napplicable central processing date, in either case, plus 1% of the amount of the foreign currency purchase or cash advance after its conversion into U.S. \\ndollars. The exchange rate in effect on the central processing date may differ from the rate in effect on either the transaction date or the posting date. \\nThe exchange rate is subject to change by VISA.  \\n15. TELEPHONE MONITORING. To ensure that you received accurate and courteous customer service, on occasion, your call may be monitored by \\nour employees or agents and you agree to any such monitoring.  \\n16. PLAN MERCHANT DISPUTES. We are not liable for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution to honor your Card and/or VISA Check. \\n17. SECURITY. Pursuant to the Credit Card Application, you grant Andrews Federal Credit Union (“Andrews FCU”), on any credit extended or cash \\nadvanced under this credit card account, a security interest in any and all of your Andrews FCU share accounts, deposits, and payments (collectively \\nreferred to as “SHARE ACCOUNTS”), whether held jointly or individually, up to the amount of your outstanding credit card account balance. Further, you \\ngive express consent to enable Andrews FCU to include any otherwise statutorily protected funds that may not otherwise be available by legal process, \\nto liquidate any Andrews FCU indebtedness, owed by you or any person who is listed as a joint owner on your credit card accounts with Andrews FCU, \\nincluding a deceased joint owner. Andrews FCU may take such action without further notice to you or any joint owner. In regard to those funds that have \\na statutory protection you understand that you may withdraw your express consent for Andrews FCU to apply such funds to pay any such indebtedness \\nby notifying Andrews FCU in writing. If your consent is withdrawn, Andrews FCU may in its sole discretion terminate any and all services that you have \\nwith Andrews FCU. In addition, the conditions of the Credit Card Application are incorporated into the terms of this Agreement.  \\n18. BILLING ADDRESS. If your Account is a joint account or if more than one person is permitted to use the Account, you agree that all notices \\nregarding the Account may be sent solely to the address shown on our billing records. You agree to give us written notice of any change in your billing \\naddress. You may do this when you mail us a payment or you may send the notice to us in a separate letter.  \\n19. EFFECT OF AGREEMENT AND AMENDMENTS. This Agreement governs all transactions on your Account even though the sales, Cash Advance, \\ncredit, or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms. We may amend the terms of this Agreement at any time. If we do so, we will notify \\nyou in writing in accordance with applicable law. Except as limited by applicable law, any amendment will apply to all then outstanding unpaid \\nindebtedness on your Account prior to the effective date of the amendment. Any such amendment will not require your written consent, and will become \\neffective as stated in the notice, but your consent (if required by applicable law) may be evidenced by your use of the Card or VISA Check after we give \\nyou notice of the amendment. We may at any time add new credit services, discontinue any credit services, or replace your Card and/or VISA Checks \\nwith others. We extend credit under Subtitle 9 of Title 12 of the Commercial Law Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland except to the extent pre-\\nempted by federal law. This Agreement is governed by the internal laws of Maryland and federal law. \\n20. VISA PLATINUM and VISA SIGNATURE REWARD CARD POINTS. Earned points will expire at the end of four years. \\n \\n\\nYOUR BILLING RIGHTS \\nKEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE \\n\\nThis notice contains important information about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. \\n \\n\\nNOTIFY US IN CASE OF ERRORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR BILL \\nIf you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet at the address listed on your \\nbill. Write to us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. \\nYou can telephone us at 1-800-654-7728, but doing so will not preserve your rights.  \\nIn your letter, give us the following information:  \\n•  Your name and account number.  \\n•  The dollar amount of the suspected error.  \\n•  Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are not sure about.  \\nIf you have authorized us to pay your credit card bill automatically from your savings or share draft account, you can stop payment on any amount you \\nthink is wrong. To stop the payment your letter must reach us three business days before the automatic payment is scheduled to occur.  \\n \\n\\nYOUR RIGHTS AND OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AFTER WE RECEIVE YOUR WRITTEN NOTICE \\nWe must acknowledge your letter within 30 days, unless we have corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, we must either correct the error or explain \\nwhy we believe the bill was correct.  \\nAfter we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question, or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill you for the amount \\nyou question, including finance charges, and we can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. You do not have to pay any questioned amount \\nwhile we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question.  \\nIf we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay any finance charges related to any questioned amount. If we did not make a \\nmistake, you may have to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will \\nsend you a statement of the amount you owe and the date that it is due.  \\n\\n\\n\\n M-113506 \\n \\n\\nIf you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to \\nus within ten days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill. And, we must tell \\nyou the name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is.  \\nIf we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct.  \\n \\n\\nSPECIAL RULE FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES \\nIf you have a problem with the quality of property or services that you purchased with a credit card and you have tried in good faith to correct the \\nproblem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the property or services. There are two limitations on this \\nright:  \\n(a) You must have made the purchase in your home state or, if not within your home state, within 100 miles of your current mailing address; and  \\n(b) The purchase price must have been more than $50.  \\nThese limitations do not apply if we own or operate the merchant, or if we mailed you the advertisement for the property or services. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n VISA PLATINUM CREDIT CARD \\nCREDIT & FEE DISCLOSURE (VARIABLE RATE) \\n\\n \\n\\nEffective Date:  January 1, 2016 \\n\\nInterest Rate and Interest Charges \\n\\n \\nFees \\n\\n \\nHow We Will Calculate Your Balance:  We use a method called “average daily balance” (including new \\npurchases).

You do not \\nhave to sign the Agreement, but once you have accepted, signed or used the Card or the Account, the \\nAgreement will be in force.  Please read it in its entirety and keep it for your records. \\n \\nContact us for any changes to the cardholder agreement since it was printed.  You may call us toll-free or \\nwrite to us at the phone number or address printed on your Statement. \\n \\nUSE OF ACCOUNT: You authorize us to pay for your Account items representing the following transactions: \\n\\n1. Purchases or leases of goods and services (“purchases”) made using the Card. \\n2. Advances (“advances”) in any of the following forms:  \\n\\n� Cash advances obtained from financial institutions, automatic teller machines (ATMs) or other \\nmeans through the use of the Card. \\n\\n� Balance transfer transactions. \\n \\nWe have no responsibility for failure of any machine, merchant financial institution or any other party to honor \\nyour Card. \\n \\nAdditionally, you agree that you will not use your Card in any illegal transaction. \\n \\nPROMISE TO PAY:  You promise to pay all amounts due on your Account.  If your Account is a joint \\naccount, you and your joint account holder promise to pay and are jointly and individually responsible for all \\namounts due on the Account.  If you let someone else use the Account, you and any joint account holder are \\nresponsible for all charges made by that person, whether or not you have notified us that the person will be \\nusing your Account and whether or not the amount of the actual use exceeds your permission. \\n \\nCREDIT LINE:  You will be advised of the credit line applicable to your Account.  You promise not to allow \\nyour outstanding balance to exceed your credit line.  However, if you exceed your credit line, we can still \\ncharge you for all purchases and advances without giving up any of our rights and we can require that you \\nimmediately pay to us any amount in excess of your credit line.  We can increase or decrease your credit line \\nat any time without prior notice.  We may from time to time establish limits on the amount of advances that \\nmay be charged to your Account.  You will be notified of any such limits. \\n \\nMINIMUM PAYMENT – APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: You must pay at least the Minimum Payment each \\nmonth by the date shown on your Statement.  The Minimum Payment will be the larger of: (a) $20.00 or (b) \\n3% of the New Balance shown on your statement (rounded upward to the nearest dollar) plus any amounts \\nthat are late or in excess of your credit line.  If your New Balance is less than $20.00, you must pay us the \\ntotal New Balance.  In addition, you may pay any part or all of the total balance of your account at any time \\nwithout incurring any prepayment charge.  If you pay more than the Minimum Payment, you must still pay at \\nleast the Minimum Payment each time we send you a Statement. \\n \\nWith regard to each payment, we will decide the order in which purchases, cash advances, finance charges, \\nfees, and costs are paid, subject to any restrictions under applicable law.  We may allow you, from time to \\ntime, to skip one or more monthly payments, and we will notify you when this option is available.  If you elect \\nto skip a payment, finance charges will continue to accrue, and the requirement to make a Minimum \\nPayment each month will resume following the skip payment period. \\n \\nSTATEMENTS: We will send you a statement at the end of each Billing Cycle when your Account has a \\ndebit or credit balance of more than $1.00 or if a finance charge has been imposed or as required by \\napplicable law (“Statement”).  We send only one Statement for all cards with your account number.  (If there \\nare two or more of you, we send the Statement to the first applicant listed on the application).  Each \\nStatement covers a Billing Cycle.  “Billing Cycle” means the days between the closing date shown on the last \\nStatement we sent you and the closing date on your current Statement. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nRevised 7/2010 2 of 5  \\n\\nCLOSING DATE: The closing date is the last day of the billing cycle; all transactions received after the \\nclosing date will appear on your next statement. \\n \\nANNUAL FEE: If your account has been assessed an annual fee, you may avoid paying this annual fee by \\nsending written notification of termination within 30 days following the mailing date of this bill, to the address \\nfound at the top of the first page of the Statement under the financial institution’s name.  You may use your \\ncard(s) during this 30 day period but immediately thereafter must send your card(s), which you have cut in \\nhalf, to the address. \\n \\nNEGATIVE CREDIT REPORTS: We may report information about your account to credit bureaus.  Late \\npayments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. \\n \\nFINANCE CHARGES: Separate finance charges for purchases and cash advances are determined by \\nmultiplying the periodic rate by the separate average daily balance for purchases and cash advances. To get \\nthe average daily balance, we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new purchases \\nor cash advances, and subtract any payments, credits, non-accruing fees and unpaid finance charges.  This \\ngives us the daily balance.  Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by \\nthe number of days in the billing cycle. \\n \\n PURCHASES: Average Daily Balance (including current transactions).  To avoid incurring an \\n additional Finance Charge on the balance of purchases reflected on your monthly statement and on \\n any new purchases appearing on your next monthly statement, you must pay the New Balance \\n shown on your monthly statement on or before the Payment Due Date.  The grace period for the \\n New Balance of purchases extends to the Payment Due Date. \\n \\n CASH ADVANCES: Average Daily Balance (including current transactions).  To avoid incurring an \\n additional Finance Charge on the beginning balance of cash advances reflected on your monthly \\n statement, you must pay the Beginning Balance shown on your  monthly statement on or before the \\n Payment Due Date.  No grace period is provided for current cycle transactions. \\n \\n FEES: We may charge your Account for the following fees.  The application and payment of a fee \\n will not correct the situation which caused the fee to be charged. \\n \\n Late Payment.  We may charge a $20.00 late fee to your Account if you do not pay at least the \\n Minimum Payment on or before the stated due date.  We may charge an additional late fee for each \\n Billing Cycle that your account is past due. \\n \\n Returned Payment.  If you make a payment on your Account with a check and that check is not \\n honored by the financial institution on which it is drawn, we may charge you a fee of $20.00. \\n \\n Cash Advance Fee.  We will add an additional finance charge to your Account each time you obtain \\n a cash advance.  This additional finance charge will be 4% of the amount of the cash advance with a \\n minimum of $5.00. \\n \\n Balance Transfer Fee.  We will add an additional finance charge to your Account each time you do \\n a balance transfer.  This additional finance charge will be 4% of the amount of the transfer with a \\n minimum of $5.00. \\n \\nENTIRE BALANCE DUE: If you fail to make a required payment when due or break any other promise \\nunder this Agreement, we can declare the entire balance of your Account due and payable at once without \\nnotice or demand.  We can also do this if you make any false or misleading statements on your application or \\nif you die or file bankruptcy. \\n \\nCOLLECTION COSTS:  To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to pay all costs and \\ndisbursements, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by us in legal proceedings to collect or enforce \\nyour indebtedness. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nRevised 7/2010 3 of 5  \\n\\nCREDIT INFORMATION:  You authorize the Bank to investigate your credit standing when opening or \\nreviewing your Account.  You authorize the Bank to disclose information regarding your Account to credit \\nbureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. \\n \\nLOST OR STOLEN CARD OR CONVENIENCE CHECKS:  If a Card is lost or stolen, you must tell us at \\nonce.  You must also tell us at once if you think someone used a Card without your permission.  You may \\neither write us a letter or call us at the address and phone number shown on your Statement.  Unless you \\nhave been grossly negligent or have engaged in fraud, you will not be liable for any unauthorized \\ntransactions using your lost or stolen card.  This additional limit on liability does not apply to ATM \\ntransactions, transactions using your Personal Identification Number (PIN) which are not processed by VISA, \\nor to commercial cards. \\n \\nWE MAY TRANSFER YOUR ACCOUNT:  We may transfer your Account and our rights under this \\nAgreement to another person or company.  That person or company will take our place in this Agreement.  \\nYou must pay them the amount you owe on your Account (instead of paying us) if they ask you.  You may \\nnot transfer your Account or your rights under this Agreement to any person or company. \\n \\nCANCELLATION:  We can cancel your Account, refuse to allow further transactions, or revoke your Card at \\nany time without prior notice.  You can cancel your Account by writing us.  In either case, you agree to return \\nall Cards cut in half to us.  Of course, cancellation of your account won’t affect your liability to us for credit we \\nhave extended to you until paid in full, including all outstanding balances, finance charges and fees. \\n \\nFOREIGN TRANSACTIONS:  Charges from foreign merchants and financial institutions may be made in a \\nforeign currency.  We will bill you in U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate on the day we settle the \\ntransaction, plus any special currency exchange charges that may be imposed by us, the VISA network \\nand/or by any third-party used to complete the transaction.  The exchange rate applied to each such \\ntransaction is (1) a rate selected by VISA from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for \\nthe applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate VISA itself receives, or (2) the \\ngovernment-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date.  Because of the special \\ncharges and possible differences in exchange rates between the time we settle and the time you initiated the \\ntransaction, the charge for a foreign transaction may be less than or greater than the cash advance or \\npurchase at the time it was made. \\n \\nRegardless of whether the transaction is made in foreign currency or in U.S. dollars, additional fees may \\napply to all international transactions using the Card.  International transactions are defined as transactions \\nthat are initiated outside the United States or its territories.  You will be billed for any international transaction \\nfees that may be imposed by us, the VISA network and/or by any third-party used to complete the \\ntransaction. \\n \\nCHANGE OF TERMS:  We can change the term of this Agreement at any time provided we send you notice \\nat least forty-five (45) days prior to the effective date of the change.  If the change will increase the Finance \\nCharges or Fees, notice shall be sent at least forty-five (45) days prior to the effective date and may become \\neffective as of the first day of your billing period during which the effective date occurs unless you give us \\nwritten notice that you do not agree to the change within forty-five (45) days of the date of the mailing.  If you \\ngive us such written notice, you will be permitted to pay the outstanding unpaid indebtedness in your Account \\nas of the effective date under the terms of the Agreement governing your Account at the time our notice was \\ngiven.  If you use your Card after the effective date, you will be considered to have agreed to the new terms \\neven if you have sent us such written notice.  At our option we may also make any such change if you elect \\nto use your account after the effective date of the amendment.  Changes which we make can apply to all \\noutstanding unpaid indebtedness and to any future transactions on your Account. \\n  \\nTELEPHONE CALLS – MONITORING:  You agree that if you are past due or in default, you will accept calls \\nfrom us regarding the collection of your Account.  You understand these calls could be automatically dialed \\nand a recorded message may be played.  You agree such calls will not be unsolicited calls for purposes of \\nstate and federal law. \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nRevised 7/2010 4 of 5  \\n\\n \\nAlbina Community Bank \\n\\nCredit Plan Terms & Conditions  \\nAnd \\n\\nYour Billing Rights \\n \\n\\nANNUAL \\nPERCENTAGE \\n\\nRATE FOR \\nPURCHASES & \\n\\nCASH ADVANCE \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nANNUAL \\nMEMBERSHIP \\n\\nFEE \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nGRACE PERIOD FOR  \\nPURCHASES \\n\\n \\nMETHOD OF \\nCOMPUTING \\n\\nTHE \\nBALANCE \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nMONTHLY \\nPAYMENT \\n\\n11.99% None, or $60 with Scorecard \\n\\n25 Days (to avoid \\nperiodic finance \\n\\ncharges on purchases, \\nthe total payoff amount \\nmust be received by the \\n\\npayment due date) \\n\\nAverage Daily \\nBalance \\n\\n(including new \\npurchases) \\n\\nMinimum 3% of \\nnew balance but \\n\\nnot less than \\n$20.00 \\n\\nLATE PAYMENT \\nFEE \\n\\nRETURN \\nPAYMENT FEE \\n\\nBALANCE TRANSFER FEE \\nCASH ADVANCE \\n\\nFEE \\nUp to $20.00 Up to $20.00 Up to 4% of the amount of the \\n\\ntransfer; $5.00 minimum fee \\nUp to 4% of the amount of the \\ntransfer; $5.00 minimum fee \\n\\nBecause rates and terms are subject to change, you may contact us for the current information by \\ncalling 1-800-922-5086. \\n \\n \\nYOUR BILLING RIGHTS – KEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE:  This notice contains important \\ninformation about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act and applies to all credit \\ncard accounts. \\n \\nNOTIFY US IN CASE OF ERRORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR BILL:  If you think your bill is wrong, or \\nif you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet at the address \\nlisted on your bill.  Write to us a soon as possible.  We must hear from you no later than sixty (60) days after \\nwe sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared.

If you need more \\n\\ninformation, describe the item you are not sure about. \\n \\nIf you have authorized us to pay your bill automatically from your savings or checking account, you can stop \\nthe payment on any amount you think is wrong.  To stop the payment, your letter must reach us three (3) \\nbusiness days before the automatic payment is scheduled to occur. \\n \\nYOUR RIGHTS AND OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AFTER WE RECEIVE YOUR WRITTEN NOTICE:  We \\nmust acknowledge your letter within thirty (30) days, unless we have corrected the error by then.  Within \\nninety (90) days, we must either correct the error or explain why we believe the bill was correct.  After we \\nreceive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question, or report you as delinquent.  We can \\ncontinue to bill you for the amount you question, including finance charges, and we can apply any unpaid \\namount against your credit limit.  You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, \\nbut you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question. \\n \\nIf we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay any finance charges related to any \\nquestioned amount.  If we did not make a mistake, you may have to pay finance charges, and you will have \\n\\n\\n\\nRevised 7/2010 5 of 5  \\n\\nto make up any missed payments on the questioned amount.  In either case, we will send you a statement of \\nthe amount you owe and the date that it is due. \\n \\nIf you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent.  However, if our \\nexplanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within ten (10) days telling us that you still refuse to pay, \\nwe must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill and, we must tell you the name \\nof anyone we reported you to.  We must tell anyone we report you to that the matter has been settled \\nbetween us when it finally is. \\n \\nIf we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50.00 of the questioned amount, even if your bill \\nwas correct. \\n \\nSPECIAL RULE FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES:  If you have a problem with the quality of property or \\nservice that you purchased with a credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the \\nmerchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the property or services.  There \\nare two limitations on this right: \\n \\n (a) You must have made the purchase in your home state or, if not within your home state, within \\n 100 miles of your mailing address; and \\n \\n (b) The purchase price must have been more than $50.00. \\n \\nThese limitations do not apply if we own or operate the merchant, or if we mailed you the advertisement for \\nthe property or services. \\n\\n\\n'],\n",

Your Amegy Bank Card has been issued by Zions Bancorporation, N.A. dba Amegy Bank. Your Account is \\nwith Zions Bancorporation, N.A. (“Bank”) and will be administered by the Bank’s Bankcard Services department. Your \\nCredit Card, monthly, statement, and other associated materials will bear the Amegy Bank name. \\n1.1: THIS CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT (\"Agreement\") is a legal contract between you and Amegy Bank that governs \\nyour credit card Account. It replaces all previous agreements, addendums, disclosures and amendments for your credit \\ncard Account. This Consumer Credit Card Agreement includes the disclosures included on the card carrier containing the \\nCard and any subsequent disclosures, all of which are fully incorporated herein by reference, and constitutes your \\nAgreement with us that covers your credit card Account. Review this Agreement carefully and keep it in your records. \\n1.2: ACCEPTING OR DECLINING THIS AGREEMENT. This Agreement is automatically accepted by you on the earlier \\nof (a) 15 days after you received your Card, or (b) immediately upon any use of your Card or Account. If you wish to \\ndecline this Agreement, do not use your Card or Account, and cancel them within 15 days of receiving your Card by \\ncalling 1-866-749-7459 or writing to the address on the carrier containing your Card. \\n1.3: DEFINITIONS FOR THIS AGREEMENT. The definitions listed below will apply throughout, both in this Agreement \\nand in your monthly statement.  \\nBank: Means Zions Bancorporation, N.A., the issuer of your Card and holder of your Account. \\nWe, us, and our: Refer to Bank. \\nYou and your: Refer to the one or more persons who receive credit from us and are liable on the Account, including the \\nprimary applicant and any co-applicant. \\nAccount: Means your Visa credit card account, together with the associated account number, all that we grant under that \\naccount, and all Card(s) issued and any Credit Card Checks made available under that account. \\nCard Agreement: Means this Agreement, together with your Card Application and the carrier containing your Card.  \\nCard Application: Means your credit application for your Account. \\nCard: Means the credit card(s) and associated card number(s) that Bank issues as part of your Account. \\nCredit Limit: Means the maximum dollar amount of credit that Bank has authorized for your Account. \\nOutstanding Balance: Means the entire amount owing on your Account at any given time. \\nCash Back: Is a cash-back rebate program of Bank for certain types of Accounts. \\nCredit Card Checks: Means checks that Bank may provide you to access your Account.  \\nMargin: The applicable Margin for your credit card Account is determined by Bank. The Margin depends on Bank’s \\ndetermination of your creditworthiness, the type of credit card Account you have, and the type of transaction for which you \\nuse your Card. The Margin applicable to your credit card Account may be changed by Bank and Bank will notify you of \\nsuch change. \\n1.4: AMENDING THIS AGREEMENT. We may amend, add or delete (i.e., “change”) any term of this Agreement at \\nany time. We will notify you of any change, and any right to reject that change, as required by law. To reject a change, \\nyou must inform us in the manner and time period specified in our notice. We will then close your Account and you will be \\nrequired to pay your Outstanding Balance as provided by applicable law. If a change requires your consent, we may \\nobtain that consent from you verbally, in writing or electronically. Whether or not consent is required, any further use of \\nyour Account after the effective date of the change shall constitute your consent and acceptance. Unless a longer period \\nis specified by law, a reasonable period for any notice to you shall not exceed 25 days from being sent. Notices may be \\nprinted on, or enclosed with, your monthly statement. \\n1.5: CREDIT LIMIT. Your Account’s initial Credit Limit appears on the carrier containing your Card. Your updated Credit \\nLimit appears on each monthly statement. You must not use or allow others to use your Card or Account in a way that \\ncauses your Outstanding Balance to exceed your Credit Limit. You are liable for the Outstanding Balance even if it \\nexceeds your Credit Limit. We may increase or decrease your Credit Limit at any time and will notify you of such change. \\nYou may request a change in your Credit Limit by contacting us. \\n\\n2.0: THE CARD. You agree to sign the back of the Card before using it. The Card is the property of the Bank. We can \\nrequire you to surrender your Card to us, or to any merchant or financial institution where you have presented the Card. \\nThe Card is not valid after its printed expiration date, but we may suspend, cancel, replace or renew your Card at any \\ntime. You may request additional Cards at no additional cost for family members or other persons that you authorize to \\nuse your Account, but you remain responsible for all of their charges.  \\n\\n3.0: USING YOUR CARD AND ACCOUNT. Subject to your Credit Limit and the other restrictions in this Agreement, card \\nnetwork rules and the law, your Card and Account can be used for the following:  \\n\\n\\n\\n3.1: Purchases. The Card may be used to purchase or lease goods or services wherever the Card is accepted. \\n3.2: Cash Advances. The Card may be used to obtain cash advances from your Account (1) in person at the Bank or any \\nparticipating financial institution, (2) by electronic online cash advance to another account, or (3) ATMs in the Bank \\nnetwork or other participating ATM networks (listed on the back of your Card). Transaction fees apply to cash advances. \\nCertain transaction limits apply, such as restricting the sum of all ATM and electronic online cash advances in your \\nAccount to $500 (or $2000 limit for Signature accounts) or less on any calendar day. Some ATMs have other limits. Cash \\nAdvances may not exceed 25% of Credit Limit (only applicable to AmaZing and Premium card products). Based on risk, \\nwe may further limit cash advances in our sole discretion. We have no obligation to you to enforce such transaction limits, \\nand you owe all cash advances made. Using your Card to withdraw cash from an ATM located outside of the United \\nStates will create a cash advance from and charge to your credit card Account, even if you select withdrawal from a \\nchecking, savings or other type of account. ”Quasi-cash transactions” such as using your Card for money orders, \\ntraveler’s checks, foreign currency, lottery tickets, or gambling chips are treated as cash advances, not purchases.  \\n3.3: Balance Transfers. You can request a balance transfer to your Account. You may not use a balance transfer to pay \\noff other debts to us. You may only make a balance transfer to pay accounts in your name. Allow 3 to 4 weeks to process \\nyour balance transfer request. During that time, you should continue making payments to those accounts. Transaction \\nFees apply. You will not earn any rewards points or cash back rebates on a balance transfer.  \\n3.4: Credit Card Checks. We may provide Credit Card Checks to access your Account. Use of a Credit Card Check \\ncreates a cash advance. Transaction Fees apply. Unused Credit Card Checks are the Bank’s property and must be \\nreturned upon request. We can revoke your privilege to use Credit Card Checks at any time, without cause or notice. You \\ncannot stop payment on a Credit Card Check.  \\n\\n4.0: MONTHLY STATEMENTS. We will send you a monthly statement summarizing each transaction on your Account \\nduring the preceding billing period. Your monthly statement will show the total amount you owed at the end of the billing \\nperiod, your minimum payment due, your payment due date (which is at least 25 days from the monthly statement closing \\ndate), and other important information. We send your monthly statement to only one address, even if the Account has \\nmultiple owners. See the “BILLING RIGHTS SUMMARY” section near the end of this Agreement for important information \\n(including the need to promptly review your monthly statement and report any errors). \\n\\n5.0: HOW THE NEW BALANCE IS DETERMINED. The total amount you owe us at the end of the current billing period \\nappears as the “New Balance” on your monthly statement. The Outstanding Balance at the end of the previous billing \\nperiod is called the “Previous Balance”. The New Balance is determined by taking the Previous Balance and (1) \\nsubtracting any payments and credits received by us during the current billing period and then (2) adding any purchases, \\ncash advances, balance transfers, interest charges, fees, and other adjustments. \\n\\n6.0: PAYMENTS. You must pay all amounts due on your Account according to the terms of this Agreement. Payments \\nmust be drawn on U.S. dollars deposited in the United States. If we accept any other payment, you must pay all \\nconversion fees, bank collection fees and other expenses we may incur. (Such fees and expenses are treated as \\npurchases.) Do not send cash payments. \\n6.1: Payment Due Date. Your payment due date is the same date each month. If the minimum payment is not received \\nby 5:00 p.m. on the due date, in the manner and at the location specified in the billing statement, there may be a delay in \\nposting your payment to your Account. Such delay may result in a late payment fee and additional interest charges. \\n6.2: Minimum Payment Amount. If the New Balance is less than $30, the minimum payment is the full amount of the \\nNew Balance. If the New Balance is $30 or more, the minimum payment is the sum of (1) any past due amount and (2) \\nthe greater of: (a) $30 plus any late payment fees, or (b) 2.5% of the New Balance plus interest charges and any late \\npayment fees. (For Visa Signature Cards, in addition to the foregoing amounts, your minimum payment amount will \\ninclude the full amount by which your New Balance exceeds your credit limit.) For all cards, making only the minimum \\npayment will increase the amount of interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance. \\n6.3: Application of Payments. Payments credited to your Account during a billing period will be applied first to unpaid \\ninterest charges, then to any fees, then to the balance having the highest Annual Percentage Rate (APR), and then to \\neach successive balance bearing the next higher APR until the payment is exhausted. Balances having the same APR \\nwill be paid beginning with the oldest balance first. You must pay at least the minimum payment amount on your \\nstatement each month, even if you paid more than the minimum payment in an earlier month. \\n6.4: Partial or Nonconforming Payments. You must not mark any payment with any kind of restrictive endorsement \\n(such as “paid in full” or “in settlement”). We can receive and credit your Account with the amount of any late payments, \\npartial payments or payments with restrictive endorsements without losing or waiving our right to receive timely payment \\nin full.  \\n6.5: Delay of Available Credit. We apply your payment to your Account on the business day we receive it. Based on risk, \\nhowever, we may delay when that payment increases your Account’s available credit.  \\n6.6: Prepayment. You may repay all or any portion of the Outstanding Balance at any time without penalty. \\n\\n7.0: RATES AND FEES: Annual Percentage Rates, Daily Periodic Rates and Fees and other disclosures are found on \\nthe Table at the end of this agreement. The card carrier containing your Card also includes disclosures specific to your \\n\\n\\n\\nCard Account. The terms of these disclosures are incorporated by reference into this Agreement. Review these \\ndisclosures carefully and keep in your records. \\n\\n8.0: DEFAULT. Your Account will be in default in any of the following circumstances: (a) your minimum payment is not \\nreceived at the proper address on or before the payment due date; (b) you fail to honor any other obligation under this \\nAgreement; (c) you die, file for bankruptcy, or become insolvent or generally unable to pay your debts; (d) you have \\nfurnished false or misleading information on the Card Application; (e) you are in default under any other obligations you \\nmay owe to us; or (f) we reasonably believe that you are unable or unwilling to honor all of your obligations under this \\nAgreement. If your Account is in default, we may declare the Outstanding Balance immediately due and payable, close \\nyour Account, and recover all Cards and unused Credit Card Checks. \\n\\n9.0: ATTORNEYS’ FEES; COLLECTION EXPENSES; VENUE IN TEXAS. You agree to pay our reasonable collection \\nexpenses, whether or not any court or arbitration proceedings are filed. Collection expenses include reasonable attorneys’ \\nfees, the cost of Bank staff (including in house counsel), and out-of-pocket expenses (whether or not such expenses are \\nawardable as “court costs”). Unless prohibited by law, you agree that we may bring legal action against you in the State of \\nTexas, regardless of where you reside. \\n\\n10.0: INTEREST CHARGES. The following interest charges will apply whether before or after default, judgment, or the \\nclosing of your Account. \\n10.1: Periodic Interest Charges on Purchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. We will not charge periodic \\ninterest on purchases and balance transfers if you pay in full the total New Balance listed on the previous monthly \\nstatement by the payment due date. Otherwise, we will charge periodic interest on each purchase and balance transfer \\nfrom the date of that purchase or balance transfer transaction. For every cash advance we charge interest from the date \\nof that transaction. There is no grace period during which a cash advance can be repaid without incurring an interest \\ncharge. \\n10.2: Periodic Interest Charge Calculation(s). There is no minimum interest charge. The interest charged on purchase \\ntransactions and balance transfer transactions is calculated separately from the interest charged on cash advances. \\nThose separately calculated interest amounts are then combined to determine the total interest charged for the billing \\nperiod. For each category of transactions, interest is calculated as follows. (1) First, we determine the “average daily \\nbalance” by taking each day’s beginning balance, adding any new transactions, and subtracting any payments or credits. \\nWe do not add interest incurred during the billing period. The result is the “daily balance.” We then add all the daily \\nbalances for the billing period and divide by the number of days in the billing period. The result is the “average daily \\nbalance” (also called the “balance subject to interest charge” on your monthly statement). (2) Second, we multiply the \\naverage daily balance by the number of days in the billing period. That number is then multiplied by the daily periodic rate \\n(DPR) for that category of transactions. The resulting number is the interest charged for that category of transactions.  \\n\\n11.0: ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (“APR”) AND DAILY PERIODIC RATE (“DPR”). The APR and DPR for all \\ntransactions are variable rates. The APR for a particular billing period is the sum of the Bank’s “Prime Rate” for that \\nbilling period plus a “Margin.” The applicable Margin depends on the type of transaction and the type of credit card \\nAccount. Daily periodic interest is calculated using the DPR. The DPR is 1/365th of the APR (or 1/366 in a leap year). The \\nAPR and DPR on the Effective Date are disclosed on the card carrier. The actual APR in effect for each billing period, and \\nfor each category of transactions, is disclosed in your monthly statement. \\n11.1: “Prime Rate” and the “Index”. The Prime Rate is equal to, and varies with, an independent index (the “Index”). \\nThe Index is the U.S. prime rate, as published by the Wall Street Journal. For any particular billing period, the Bank’s \\nPrime Rate is the published Index rate for the day that precedes by 6 business days the first calendar day of the calendar \\nmonth in which that billing period ends (If a range of rates is published for that date, the highest of the rates is used). If the \\nIndex becomes unavailable, the Bank may designate a substitute Index in its sole discretion. Your APR and DPR, and the \\namount of your minimum payment, will increase or decrease as the Index and Bank’s Prime Rate increase or decrease. \\nThe resulting changes in your APR and DPR will take effect on the first day of your billing cycle the following month. You \\nacknowledge that the Bank’s Prime Rate does not mean the lowest rate at which Bank makes loans to any of its \\ncustomers, now or in the future.  \\n11.2: Military Lending Act (MLA). The Military Lending Act provides protections for members of the Armed Forces and \\ntheir dependents.  \\n11.2.1: Statement of MAPR (Military Annual Percentage Rate).

READ IT CAREFULLY. No portion of this \\nDispute Resolution section shall be interpreted or applied in a manner prohibited by governing law, but all other portions \\nshall remain in effect. Without limitation, no portion of this Dispute Resolution section shall require arbitration or other non-\\njudicial procedure to resolve any controversy or settle any claim arising out of any consumer credit transaction that is \\nsecured by a dwelling (including a home equity line of credit secured by the consumer’s principal dwelling). The jury \\nwaiver, class action waiver, and arbitration agreement in this Dispute Resolution provision do not apply to you if, \\nas of the date of this agreement, you are a member of the Armed Forces or a dependent of such member entitled \\nto protection under the Federal Military Lending Act. \\n\\nSECTION 1: GENERAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING ALL DISPUTES. \\n27.1.1: PRIOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION AGREEMENTS SUPERSEDED. This Dispute Resolution Provision shall \\nsupersede and replace any prior “Jury Waiver,” “Judicial Reference,” “Class Action Waiver,” “Arbitration,” \\n“Dispute Resolution,” or similar alternative dispute agreement or provision between or among the parties. \\n\\n\\n\\n27.1.2: “DISPUTE” DEFINED. As used herein, the word “Dispute” includes, without limitation, any claim by either party \\nagainst the other party related to this Agreement, your Account, any transaction in your Account, any Card or a Credit \\nCard Check. “Dispute” includes, but is not limited to, matters arising from or relating to a deposit account, an application \\nfor or denial of credit, warranties and representations made by a party, the adequacy of a party’s disclosures, enforcement \\nof any and all of the obligations a party hereto may have to another party, compliance with applicable laws and/or \\nregulations, performance or services provided under any agreement by a party, including without limitation disputes based \\non or arising from any alleged tort or matters involving the employees, officers, agents, affiliates, or assigns of a party \\nhereto.  \\n \\nIf a third party is a party to a Dispute (such as a credit reporting agency, merchant accepting a credit card, junior \\nlienholder or title company), each party hereto agrees to consent to including that third party in any arbitration or judicial \\nreference proceeding for resolving the Dispute with that third party. \\n \\n27.1.3: JURY WAIVER. Each party waives its, his or her respective rights to a trial before a jury in connection with \\nany Dispute. All Disputes shall be decided by a judge sitting without a jury, unless submitted to binding arbitration \\npursuant to Section 2 or judicial reference pursuant to Section 3. \\n \\nThis Agreement includes an arbitration agreement, which will have a substantial effect on your rights in the event \\nof a dispute with us. For example, if we elect to require you to arbitrate any claim, you will not have the right to a \\njury trial or the right to participate in a class action in court or in arbitration. However, the arbitration agreement \\ndoes not apply if, as of the date of this agreement, you are a member of the armed forces or a dependent of such \\nmember covered by the Federal Military Lending Act. Please see the section of this agreement labeled “Military \\nLending Act.”  \\n \\n27.1.4. AGREEMENT FOR BINDING ARBITRATION OR JUDICIAL REFERENCE (A) IF A CONSUMER PARTY \\nREQUESTS, OR (B) IF THE JURY TRIAL WAIVER IS NOT ENFORCED. A party who (in context of the Dispute) is a \\nconsumer may timely elect to require that the Dispute be submitted as applicable to binding arbitration under Section 2 \\nhereof or binding judicial reference under Section 3 hereof. In addition, if this Agreement’s jury waiver is unenforceable by \\nlaw, or otherwise not enforced by a court exercising jurisdiction over the Dispute, then all parties hereby agree that the \\nDispute shall be timely submitted as applicable to binding arbitration under Section 2 or binding judicial reference under \\nSection 3. BY AGREEING TO RESOLVE SPECIFIED FUTURE DISPUTES IN ARBITRATION OR BY JUDICIAL \\nREFERENCE, THE PARTIES ARE WAIVING THEIR RIGHT TO LITIGATE THOSE DISPUTES IN COURT. \\n \\nIn any lawsuit regarding a Dispute (a “Lawsuit”), following the service of a complaint, third-party complaint, cross-claim or \\ncounterclaim or any answer thereto, any amendment to any of the above, or a ruling or entry of an order that has the \\neffect of invalidating this Agreement’s jury trial waiver (any of the foregoing, an “ADR Event”), then at any time prior to \\ntrial of the Dispute, but not later than 30 days after the ADR Event, any party shall be entitled to move the court for an \\norder (on the grounds set forth in the preceding paragraph) compelling arbitration under Section 2 or judicial reference \\nunder Section 3, as applicable, and staying or dismissing the Lawsuit pending such arbitration or judicial reference (an \\n“ADR Order”). A party that commenced or participated in the Lawsuit may nevertheless demand arbitration or judicial \\nreference of a Dispute after an ADR Event. Commencement or participation in the Lawsuit shall not operate as a waiver of \\nthe right to compel arbitration or judicial reference. After entry of an ADR Order, the non-moving party shall commence the \\narbitration or judicial reference. The moving party shall, at its discretion, also be entitled to commence arbitration or \\njudicial reference but is under no obligation to do so, and the moving party shall not in any way be adversely prejudiced by \\nelecting not to commence arbitration or judicial reference. \\n \\n27.1.5: CLASS ACTION WAIVER. If permitted by applicable law, each party waives the right to litigate any Dispute \\nas a class action (either as a member of a class or as a representative) or to act as a private attorney general. The \\nwaiver in this paragraph applies whether the proceeding is in a court, in an arbitration, or in a judicial reference \\nproceeding.  \\n \\n27.1.6: SURVIVAL: This Dispute Resolution Provision shall survive any termination, amendment, or expiration of this \\nAgreement, or any other relationship between the parties.  \\n \\nSECTION 2: TERMS GOVERNING THOSE DISPUTES SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION. This Section 2 governs \\nDisputes that are submitted for binding arbitration under subsection 27.1.4. This Section 2 shall not apply to any Dispute \\nthat is pending in a state or federal court located in the State of California, except to the extent such Dispute may also be \\npending in a state or federal court located outside of California. An arbitrator shall have no authority to determine the \\nvalidity, enforceability, meaning and scope of this Dispute Resolution Provision, or (ii) class action claims brought by \\neither party as a class representative on behalf of others, or by a class representative on either party’s behalf as a class \\nmember, which matters may be determined only by a court without a jury. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nArbitration under this provision shall be conducted before a single arbitrator through either the National Arbitration Forum \\n(“NAF”) or Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (JAMS), as selected by the initiating party, in accordance with \\nthe rules of NAF or JAMS (the “Administrator”). However, if the parties agree, a licensed attorney may be selected by the \\nparties to conduct the arbitration without an Administrator. If NAF and JAMS both decline to administer arbitration of the \\nDispute, and if the parties are unable to mutually agree upon a licensed attorney to act as arbitrator without an \\nAdministrator, then either party may file a Lawsuit and move for an ADR Order. The arbitrator, howsoever appointed, shall \\nhave expertise in the subject matter of the Dispute. Venue for the arbitration proceeding shall be as stated elsewhere in \\nthis Agreement with respect to any judicial proceedings between the parties. Absent such a provision, the arbitration shall \\nbe conducted at a location determined by mutual agreement of the parties or by the Administrator if no agreement can be \\nreached. The arbitrator shall apply the law of the state specified in the agreement giving rise to the Dispute. \\n \\nIn any arbitration commenced by a consumer regarding a consumer Dispute, Lender or Bank shall pay one half of the \\nAdministrator\\'s initial filing fee, up to $500. If Lender or Bank commences arbitration or is the moving party obtaining an \\nADR Order, Lender or Bank shall pay all Administrator and arbitrator fees, regardless of whether or not the consumer is \\nthe prevailing party in such arbitration, unless such Dispute involves a claim for damages by a consumer and is found by \\nthe arbitrator to be frivolous. For this paragraph, “consumer Dispute” shall mean a Dispute involving credit or services \\nprovided by Lender or Bank, primarily for personal, family or household purposes, in which the claim for damages is less \\nthan $75,000. \\n \\nThe Administrator and the arbitrator shall have the authority, to the extent practicable, to take any reasonable action to \\nrequire the arbitration proceeding to be completed within 180 days of commencing the arbitration. The arbitrator: (i) will \\nrender a decision and any award applying applicable law; (ii) will hear and rule on appropriate dispositive motions for \\njudgment on the pleadings, for failure to state a claim, or for full or partial summary judgment; (iii) will give effect to any \\nstatutory or contractual limitations period (e.g., any statute of limitations) in determining any Dispute or defense; (iv) shall \\nhave the authority to impose sanctions on any party that fails to comply with time periods imposed by the Administrator or \\nthe arbitrator, including, without limitation, the sanction of entering a final award against the party that fails to comply; (v) \\nshall have authority to award costs and fees (including attorneys\\' fees and costs, arbitration administration fees and costs, \\nand arbitrator(s)\\' fees) to the extent permitted by law; (vi) shall recognize and honor claims of privilege recognized at law; \\nand (vii) with regard to motions and the arbitration hearing, shall apply the Federal Rules of Evidence. The doctrines of \\ncompulsory counterclaim, res judicata, and collateral estoppel shall apply to any arbitration proceeding hereunder. \\n \\nCommencement of an arbitration by any party shall not prevent any party from at any time (i) seeking and obtaining from \\na court of competent jurisdiction (notwithstanding ongoing arbitration) provisional or ancillary remedies including but not \\nlimited to injunctive relief, temporary restraining orders, property preservation orders, foreclosure, sequestration, eviction, \\nattachment, replevin, garnishment, and/or the appointment of a receiver; or (ii) availing itself of any self-help remedies \\nsuch as setoff and repossession rights or non-judicial foreclosure of collateral. The exercise of such rights shall not \\nconstitute a waiver of the right to submit any Dispute to arbitration. \\n \\nJudgment upon an arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction except that, if the arbitration award \\nexceeds $200,000, any party shall be entitled to a de novo appeal of the award before a panel of three arbitrators. To \\nallow for such appeal, if the award (including Administrator, arbitrator, and attorney’s fees and costs) exceeds $200,000, \\nthe arbitrator will issue a written, reasoned decision supporting the award, including a statement of authority and its \\napplication to the Dispute. A request for de novo appeal must be filed with the arbitrator within 30 days following the date \\nof the arbitration award; if such a request is not made within that time period, the arbitration award shall become final and \\nbinding. On appeal, the arbitrators shall review the award de novo, meaning that they shall reach their own findings of \\nfact and conclusions of law rather than deferring in any manner to the original arbitrator. Appeal of an arbitration award \\nshall be pursuant to the rules of the Administrator; if the Administrator has no such rules, then the JAMS arbitration \\nappellate rules shall apply. \\n \\nTo request information on how to submit an arbitration claim, or to request a copy of an Administrator’s rules or fee \\nschedule, please contact the Administrators as follows: JAMS: 1920 Main St., Suite 300, Irvine, CA 92614, Phone: \\n(949) 224-1810, Fax: (949) 224-1818, E-mail: info@jamsadr.com, Website: www.jamsadr.com; NAF: National Arbitration \\nForum, P.O. Box 50191, Minneapolis, MN 55405-0191, Phone (800) 474-2371, email: info@adrforum.com, Website: \\nwww.adrforum.com. \\n \\nArbitration under this provision concerns a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the \\nFederal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. If the terms of this Section 2 vary from the Administrator’s rules, this Section 2 \\nshall control.  \\n \\nSECTION 3: TERMS GOVERNING THOSE DISPUTES SUBMITTED TO JUDICIAL REFERENCE. This Section 3 \\ngoverns Disputes that are submitted under subsection 27.1.4 for judicial reference in accordance with California Code of \\nCivil Procedure, Section 638, et seq. This Section 3 may be invoked only with regard to Disputes filed in state or federal \\n\\n\\n\\ncourts located in the State of California. In no event shall this Section 3 diminish the force or effect of any venue selection \\nor jurisdiction provision in this Agreement or any Related Document. Nothing herein shall preclude a party from moving \\n(prior to the court ordering judicial reference) to dismiss, stay or transfer the suit to a forum outside California on grounds \\nthat California is an improper, inconvenient or less suitable venue. If such motion is granted, this Section 3 shall not apply \\nto any proceedings in the new forum.  \\n \\nThe referee shall be a retired judge, agreed upon by the parties, from either the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or \\nJudicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (JAMS). If the parties cannot agree on the referee, the party who initially \\nselected the reference procedure shall request a panel of ten retired judges from either AAA or JAMS, and the court shall \\nselect the referee from that panel. If AAA and JAMS are unavailable to provide this service, the court may select a referee \\nby such other procedures as are used by that court. The referee shall be appointed to sit with all of the powers provided \\nby law, including the power to hear and determine any or all of the issues in the proceeding, whether of fact or of law, and \\nto report a statement of decision. Only for this Section 3, “Dispute” includes matters regarding the validity, enforceability, \\nmeaning, or scope of this Section, and class action claims brought by either party as a class representative on behalf of \\nothers and claims by a class representative on either party’s behalf as a class member. The parties agree that time is of \\nthe essence in conducting the judicial reference proceeding set forth herein. Except as otherwise provided in this \\nparagraph, the costs of the judicial reference proceeding, including the fee for the court reporter, shall be borne equally by \\nthe parties as the costs are incurred, unless otherwise awarded by the referee. If Lender or Bank commences a judicial \\nreference proceeding regarding a consumer Dispute, Lender or Bank shall pay all referee fees, regardless of whether or \\nnot the consumer is the prevailing party in such proceeding, unless such Dispute involves a claim for damages by a \\nconsumer and is found by the referee to be frivolous. For purposes of this paragraph, “consumer Dispute” shall mean a \\nDispute involving credit or services provided by Lender or Bank, primarily for personal, family or household purposes, in \\nwhich the claim for damages is less than $75,000. The referee shall hear all pre-trial and post-trial matters (including \\nwithout limitation requests for equitable relief), prepare a statement of decision with written findings of fact and \\nconclusions of law and apportion costs as appropriate. The referee shall be empowered to enter equitable relief as well as \\nlegal relief, provide all temporary or provisional remedies, enter equitable orders that are binding on the parties and rule \\non any motion that would be authorized in a trial, including without limitation motions for summary adjudication. Judgment \\nupon the award shall be entered in the court in which such proceeding was commenced and all parties shall have full \\nrights of appeal. This provision will not be deemed to limit or constrain Lender’s or Bank’s right of offset, to obtain \\nprovisional or ancillary remedies, to interplead funds in the event of a dispute, to exercise any security interest or lien \\nBank or Lender may hold in property, or to comply with legal process involving accounts or other property held by Bank or \\nLender. \\n \\nSECTION 4: RELIANCE. Each party (i) certifies that no one has represented to such party that the other party would not \\nseek to enforce a jury waiver, class action waiver, arbitration provision or judicial reference provision in the event of suit, \\nand (ii) acknowledges that it and the other party have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, \\nmaterial reliance upon the mutual waivers, agreements, and certifications in the four Sections of this DISPUTE \\nRESOLUTION PROVISION. \\n \\n28.0: BILLING RIGHTS SUMMARY.

In your letter, include the following information: \\n\\n• Your name and account number. \\n• The date and dollar amount of the suspected error. \\n• Describe the error, and explain if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, \\n\\ndescribe the item you are not sure about. \\nIf you have authorized us to pay your Account automatically from your savings or checking account or you have \\nauthorized an automatic payment on your Account, you can stop the payment on any amount you think is wrong. To stop \\nthe payment your letter must reach us three business days before the automatic payment is scheduled to occur. \\n28.2: Your Rights and Our Responsibilities After We Receive Your Written Notice. We must acknowledge your letter \\nwithin 30 days, unless we corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, we must either correct the error or explain why we \\nbelieve the bill was correct.  \\nAfter we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question, or report you as delinquent. We can \\ncontinue to bill you for the amount you question, including interest charges, and we can apply any unpaid amount against \\nyour Credit Limit. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to \\npay the parts of your bill that are not in question.  \\nIf we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest charges \\nrelated to any questioned amount. If we didn’t make a mistake, you may have to pay interest charges, and you will have to \\n\\n\\n\\nmake any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you \\nowe and the date that it is due.  \\nIf you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not \\nsatisfy you and you write to us within ten (10) days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you \\nto that you have a question about your bill. And, we must tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell \\nanyone we report you to that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is. If we don’t follow these rules, we \\ncan’t collect the first $50 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct. \\n28.3: Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases. If you are dissatisfied with the goods or \\nservices that you have purchased with your Card and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the \\nmerchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the \\nfollowing must be true:  \\n\\n(1) The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and\\nthe purchase must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on\\nan advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)\\n(2) You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with\\na check that access your credit card account do not qualify.\\n(3) You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.\\n\\nIf all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at: \\n\\nAmegy Bank Bankcard Services \\nP.O. Box 25787 \\n\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84125-0787 \\n\\nWhile we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, \\nwe will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as \\ndelinquent. \\n\\nRevised 09/01/2019 A division of Zions Bancorporation, N.A.

This is called check truncation or check conversion. An \\n\\nexplanation of check conversion can be found on the back of your statement.  However, should \\n\\nyou need a copy of a check you may contact us and we will provide it to you.

If your Account has a one-time Processing Fee as disclosed in the \\n\\n“Schedule of Rates and Fees” enclosed with this Agreement, we will require it to be paid in full \\n\\nbefore your Account is opened. This fee is not charged to your Account. We will refund this \\n\\nfee if we do not approve you for an Account. \\n\\nRefund Disclosure. We will refund your Processing Fee if we do not approve you for \\n\\nan account. Furthermore, you may reject this account, provided you have not yet used the \\n\\nAccount or paid a fee after receiving a billing statement. If you do reject the plan, you are not \\n\\nresponsible for any fees or charges, including any Processing Fee(s) paid prior to opening your \\n\\naccount. Any such Processing Fee(s) previously paid will be refunded within thirty days upon \\n\\neither 1) receipt of notice to us of your rejection of the plan or 2) notice to you that your \\n\\napplication was not approved.  \\n\\n Our Charges. You agree to pay us the following fees in connection with your Account \\n\\nas disclosed in the “Schedule of Rates and Fees” enclosed with this Agreement.

The \\n\\namounts of these fees are listed in the “Schedule of Rates and Fees” enclosed with this \\n\\nAgreement. Such fees will be treated as Purchases on your Account. Our assessment of Late \\n\\nFees and Returned Payment Fees does not mean you are permitted to engage in conduct giving \\n\\nrise to these fees. In fact, you agree not to engage in such conduct. \\n\\n 1. Account Origination Fee.

Monthly Maintenance Fee (MMF).  If your Account has a MMF it will be imposed \\n\\nfor each Billing Cycle or portion thereof your Account is open or has a balance (unless \\n\\notherwise noted on the “Schedule of Rates and Fees”). The MMF will be charged to your \\n\\nAccount on each Closing Date.  If your account is closed by you or us, we will continue to \\n\\ncharge the MMF until you pay your outstanding balance in full and terminate your Account \\n\\nrelationship. \\n\\n4. Copying Charges. If you request duplicates of any Statement, Cash Advance Check \\n\\nor other documents (except in connection with proper and timely written notice of a billing \\n\\nerror), we will charge you a fee for each copy we provide, unless applicable state law requires \\n\\nus to charge a lesser amount. This fee will be charged to your Account on the date that your \\n\\nrequest is processed. \\n\\n 5. Late Fee. We will charge a Late Fee if we do not receive your Minimum Payment by \\n\\nthe Payment Due Date shown on your Statement in accordance with any hour of receipt and \\n\\n\\n\\n 5 \\n\\nother payment instructions appearing on your Statement. This fee will be charged to your \\n\\nAccount on your Payment Due Date if your Minimum Payment is not received.   \\n\\n6. Returned Payment Fee. If any check, draft, or other payment method we allow, \\n\\nelectronic or otherwise, that is submitted as payment for sums owing on your Account, or for \\n\\nany other purpose, is returned unpaid or charged back to us for any reason, we will charge a \\n\\nReturned Payment Fee. This fee will be charged to your Account on the date that your returned \\n\\npayment is processed. \\n\\n 7. Reinstatement Fee. If you or we terminate credit privileges on your Account for any \\n\\nreason, at your request and in our sole discretion we may reinstate your Account privileges. To \\n\\nbe eligible for reinstatement you must resolve any Default to our satisfaction. If we reinstate \\n\\nyour Account, we will charge you a Reinstatement Fee on the date that your request is \\n\\nprocessed.  \\n\\n 8. Stop Payment Fee. If we stop payment on any Cash Advance Check or other Cash \\n\\nAdvance at your request, we will charge a Stop Payment Fee on the date that your request is \\n\\nprocessed. Stop Payment orders are permissible, subject to applicable law, by mail or by phone \\n\\non any Cash Advance Check that has not posted to your Account and is received at such time \\n\\nas to give the Bank a reasonable opportunity to act. To request a stop payment, you must \\n\\nprecisely identify the type of Cash Advance Check, the check number, date of Cash Advance \\n\\nCheck, the exact amount of the item, and the payee. However, at our option, and to the extent \\n\\nthat we are able, we may honor Stop Payment requests that do not identify the Cash Advance \\n\\nCheck with as great a degree of precision as that specified in the immediately preceding \\n\\nsentence. Only the person who initiated the Stop Payment may make a release of the Stop \\n\\nPayment request. Oral Stop Payment orders are binding for fourteen (14) days only, unless you \\n\\nconfirm the order in writing and we receive it within the fourteen-day period. When a Stop \\n\\nPayment request form is properly signed and returned, the order is effective for six (6) months \\n\\nafter the latest date the written confirmation is received, accepted, and recorded on your \\n\\nAccount, at which time it will automatically expire. The Bank will not be liable for any \\n\\nreasonable delay in accepting and recording a Stop Payment to your Account. \\n\\n 9. Additional Card Fee. After the initial Card has been issued for your Account, if you \\n\\nrequest and we agree to provide an additional Card to be issued in the name of an Authorized \\n\\nUser or you request and we agree to permit an Authorized User who accepts full contractual \\n\\nliability for the account, to be added to your Account, we will charge an Additional Card Fee \\n\\nfor the approval of your request and the issuance of another Card to your Account. This fee will \\n\\nbe charged to your Account on the date that your request is processed. \\n\\n 10. Replacement Card Fee. After a Card has been issued in your name, if you request \\n\\nand we agree to provide a replacement Card, we will charge a Replacement Card Fee for the \\n\\nCard’s replacement. This fee also applies to any Authorized User. This fee will be charged to \\n\\nyour Account on the date that your request is processed. \\n\\n 11. Automated Account Information Fee. We will charge you to access our \\n\\nautomated account information system through our toll free telephone number. The first two \\n\\ninquiries per Billing Cycle will not incur a charge. Thereafter, a fee for each separate Account \\n\\ninquiry you make through our automated account information system will be assessed. This \\n\\nfee(s) will be charged to your Account on the same day that you make your inquires. You will \\n\\nbe charged for each separate inquiry you make even if you make more than one inquiry during \\n\\nthe same call. This fee may also be referred and listed on your Statement as an “excessive \\n\\npinpoint transaction.” \\n\\n\\n\\n 6 \\n\\n 12. Fees for Optional Payments. If you choose and we allow you to make an \\n\\nexpedited payment by telephone with the assistance of one of our associates or agents to post to \\n\\nyour Account the same day or, if the payment is made or received after 5:00 p.m., we will \\n\\nassess a fee to your account on the date that your payment is initiated. \\n\\n 13. Miscellaneous Fees. If permitted by applicable law, we may charge you any \\n\\nreasonable fees for services rendered or for reimbursement of expenses, incurred in good faith \\n\\nby us or our agents in connection with your Account, or other reasonable fees in connection \\n\\nwith our administering, terminating or reinstating your Account. For example, if you continue \\n\\nto use the Account after we advise you that your credit privileges have been terminated, we \\n\\nmay charge you for any fee imposed on recapture of the Card(s) or Cash Advance Checks. \\n\\n Interest Charges. Your Account is subject to the following Interest Charges, which \\n\\nmay appear as either a Fee or Interest on your Statement: (1) a Cash Advance Fee, which is \\n\\nimposed on the same day we honor any Cash Advance and added to your Cash Advance \\n\\nbalance (please note that in the Billing Cycle in which a Cash Advance is posted, the Cash \\n\\nAdvance Fee will cause the “Annual Percentage Rate” for Cash Advances to exceed the \\n\\n“Corresponding Annual Percentage Rate” for Cash Advances shown on your Statement for that \\n\\nBilling Cycle); (2) a “Periodic Rate Interest Charge,” which is calculated on the Purchase and \\n\\nCash Advance average daily balance of your Account as described in this Agreement. This \\n\\ncharge will be assessed to your Account on the Closing Date; (3) a “Credit Limit Increase Fee” \\n\\nwhich may be charged on the same day we approve each unsecured credit limit increase after \\n\\nyour Account is opened; (4) an “Upgrade Fee”, which may be charged on the same date we \\n\\napprove any product upgrade (i.e. standard to gold); (5) a “Foreign Currency Transaction Fee” \\n\\nis applied to any transaction made in a foreign currency that is converted to U. S. Dollars by \\n\\nVisa or MasterCard or any transaction made in a foreign country even if it is in U.S. Dollars \\n\\n(please note that this fee will be added on the same date to the same balance to which the \\n\\nforeign transaction is added); and (6) a “Minimum Interest Charge”, which will be charged for \\n\\na Billing Cycle during which there exists any Purchases and/or Cash Advances balance of $1 or \\n\\ngreater in your Account. \\n\\n Grace Period. There is no Grace Period for the Account. Interest Charges accrue on \\n\\nPurchases, Cash Advances and Our Charges beginning on the date the transaction occurs or on \\n\\nthe first day of the Billing Cycle in which the transaction is received by us or, at our option, the \\n\\ndate the transaction is posted to your Account. Periodic Rate Interest Charges continue to \\n\\naccrue until payment in full is received.  \\n\\n Periodic Rate Interest Charge Calculation-Average Daily Balance Method \\n\\n(Including New Transactions) for Purchases and Cash Advances. \\n\\n (1) To determine the Periodic Rate Interest Charge for Purchases and Cash Advances \\n\\nwe multiply the monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases and Cash Advances by the “average daily \\n\\nbalance” for Purchases and Cash Advances (including new transactions) for the current Billing \\n\\nCycle.  \\n\\n (2) The total Interest Charge imposed on your Account each Billing Cycle is the sum of \\n\\nthe Periodic Rate Interest Charges as calculated for Purchases and Cash Advances for the \\n\\ncurrent Billing Cycle, all Cash Advance Fees, and any Fees described in the Our Charges \\n\\nsection of this agreement that may be imposed during such Billing Cycle.  \\n\\n (3) Purchases. To get the “average daily balance” of Purchases for a Billing Cycle, we \\n\\ntake the beginning balance of Purchases in your Account each day, add any new Purchases, and \\n\\nsubtract any payments or credits which are applied to Purchases (treating any negative balances \\n\\n\\n\\n 7 \\n\\nas zero). On the first day of each Billing Cycle, we add the unpaid Periodic Rate Interest \\n\\nCharges for Purchases for the prior Billing Cycle to the daily balance of Purchases. (In this \\n\\nway, we compound Interest Charges on Purchases on your Account on a monthly basis.) This \\n\\ngives us the daily balance of Purchases. Then, we add up all the daily balances of Purchases for \\n\\nthe Billing Cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us \\n\\nthe “average daily balance” of Purchases for a Billing Cycle. There is no grace period in which \\n\\nPurchases may be repaid without incurring an Interest Charge.  \\n\\n (4) Cash Advances. To get the “average daily balance” of Cash Advances for a Billing \\n\\nCycle, we take the beginning balance of Cash Advances in your Account each day, add any \\n\\nnew Cash Advances, and subtract any payments or credits which are applied to Cash Advances \\n\\n(treating any negative balances as zero). On the first day of each Billing Cycle, we add the \\n\\nunpaid Periodic Rate Interest Charges for Cash Advances for the prior Billing Cycle to the \\n\\ndaily balance of Cash Advances. (In this way, we compound Interest Charges on Cash \\n\\nAdvances on your Account on a monthly basis.) This gives us the daily balance of Cash \\n\\nAdvances. Then, we add up all the daily balances of Cash Advances for the Billing Cycle and \\n\\ndivide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the “average daily \\n\\nbalance” of Cash Advances for a Billing Cycle. There is no grace period in which Cash \\n\\nAdvances may be repaid without incurring an Interest Charge.  \\n\\n (5) General Periodic Rates. See “Schedule of Rates and Fees” enclosed with this \\n\\nAgreement.  \\n\\nCredit Availability. If payments on your account are made by guaranteed funds (for \\n\\nexample, money orders and cashier’s checks), your credit availability will be increased on the \\n\\nday after your deposit or payment is credited. All other deposits or payments may not increase \\n\\nyour credit availability until we are assured that the payment has not been dishonored. This \\n\\ncould take up to 14 calendar days (or longer). \\n\\n Minimum Payments. You may pay your entire balance at any time, without penalty or \\n\\npremium. Whenever a balance is due, however, each month you must pay us at least the \\n\\nMinimum Payment Due, which we must receive on or before the Payment Due Date shown on \\n\\nthe Statement, in accordance with any hour of receipt and other payment instructions shown on \\n\\nyour monthly Statement. The Payment Due Date will be approximately 25 days after the \\n\\nClosing Date. The Minimum Payment Due in any monthly Billing Cycle will be equal to the \\n\\nsum of (i) 2.25% of your New Balance plus the total of all Periodic Rate Interest Charges that \\n\\nhave accrued in the Billing Cycle for which the Minimum Payment is being calculated \\n\\n(rounded up to the next dollar) or $35, whichever is more (or your entire New Balance if less \\n\\nthan $35); plus (ii) all past due amounts; plus (iii) the amount of any Late Fee charged in the \\n\\nBilling Cycle for which the Minimum Payment is being calculated. \\n\\n Subject to applicable law, we will apply and allocate payment up to the Minimum \\n\\nPayment Due and any credits on your Account among balances and Charges in any order and \\n\\nmanner determined by us in our sole discretion. You agree that we have the unconditional right \\n\\nto exercise this discretion in a way that is most favorable or convenient to us. Generally, the \\n\\namount of payments credited to your Account during a Billing Cycle will be applied first to the \\n\\nbalance bearing the lowest APR and then to balances bearing the higher APR, until the \\n\\nMinimum Payment Due payable in the Billing Cycle is credited to your Account. After that, the \\n\\namount of payments remaining will be applied to the balance bearing the highest APR and then \\n\\nto balances bearing the lower APR in descending order. In most cases, credits will be applied \\n\\nfirst to the balance from which the corresponding debit originated. \\n\\n\\n\\n 8 \\n\\n Security. You grant us a security interest and pledge and assign to us any and all sums \\n\\nnow or later in any Deposit established by you to secure payment of all of your existing and \\n\\nfuture obligations under this Agreement and your Account. The Deposit must be maintained \\n\\nwith us unencumbered (i.e. not subject to any lien, judgment, attachment or execution) at all \\n\\ntimes. You may add to the Deposit at any time. With our consent, you may also withdraw from \\n\\nthe Deposit, which will reduce your Credit Limit by a like amount, so long as you do not cause \\n\\nthe outstanding balance in the Account to exceed your new, lower Credit Limit. You agree that \\n\\nwe may restrict your right to obtain withdrawals from the Deposit. Upon a Default and without \\n\\nnotice to you, we may apply any sums then in the Deposit against what you then owe on your \\n\\nAccount. We may retain the Deposit or any sums remaining in the Deposit until the latest of the \\n\\nfollowing events: (i) 14 days after the time all sums owed to us on your Account are paid in \\n\\nfull, (ii) 10 weeks from the time we receive from you all of the unexpired Cards and Cash \\n\\nAdvance Checks, cut in half, or (iii) 10 weeks from the time of termination of your Account. \\n\\nExcept for the Deposit, we do not have a security interest in any other of your property in \\n\\nconnection with your Account. \\n\\n Terminating Credit Privileges and Closing Your Account. You or we can terminate \\n\\nyour credit privileges at any time for any reason, including but not limited to when you are in \\n\\nDefault under this Agreement. If you or we terminate your credit privileges, you promise that \\n\\nany amounts that you owe us at the time of termination, plus any new Purchases or Cash \\n\\nAdvances, plus any Interest Charges and other fees and charges that will continue to be \\n\\nimposed at the rates and in the amounts specified in this Agreement, will be repaid according to \\n\\nthis Agreement.  \\n\\n You may Close your Account at any time. In order to close your Account, you must: \\n\\ngive us written notice of your intent to close your Account at the address for inquiries shown on \\n\\nyour Statement, and pay your outstanding balance in full. Your notice to close your Account \\n\\nwill become effective as soon as we can reasonably act on it. If you request to close your \\n\\nAccount, but do not pay your outstanding balance in full, your credit privileges will be \\n\\nterminated. If you close your account, the terms of this Agreement remain in effect. \\n\\nDefault. You will be in default of this Agreement (“Default”) if any of the following \\n\\noccur:  \\n\\n  1. You do not make a Minimum Payment on your Account on or before the \\n\\nPayment Due Date; \\n\\n  2. You die or are declared legally incompetent; \\n\\n  3. You become insolvent or bankrupt; \\n\\n  4. You exceed or attempt to exceed the Credit Limit; \\n\\n  5. You provide us with false or misleading information or signatures at any time \\n\\nor use your Account in any fraudulent or unlawful manner; \\n\\n  6. You fail to comply with this Agreement; \\n\\n  7. You fail to make any payment or perform any promise in any other agreement \\n\\nor obligation you have with us; or  \\n\\n  8. Any judgment, lien, attachment or execution is issued against you, the \\n\\nDeposit or your other property. \\n\\n If you are in Default, we may immediately terminate your credit privileges on your \\n\\nAccount and any other credit account(s) you may have with us. We need not give you notice of \\n\\ntermination. We may also demand that you immediately pay us all sums owing on your \\n\\nAccount and any other credit account(s) you may have with us, including all unpaid Interest \\n\\n\\n\\n 9 \\n\\nCharges and other charges. We may also combine the outstanding balance on your Account \\n\\nwith the balances of any other credit account(s) you may have with us regardless of whether or \\n\\nnot that account is past due. Without notice to you, we may also apply any sums then in the \\n\\nDeposit, including interest, if any, you earned on the Deposit, against what you then owe on \\n\\nyour Account. We may also demand that you cut the Card(s) and Cash Advance Checks in half \\n\\nand immediately return them to us. Although we may have declared your Account to be in \\n\\nDefault, you agree to pay us Interest Charges and other charges at the rates provided in this \\n\\nAgreement until all sums you owe us are paid in full, even if we have demanded that you make \\n\\nimmediate payment in full. \\n\\n If we waive a Default, we do not waive the right to declare the same or another event \\n\\noccurring later as a Default of your Account. If we start collection proceedings to recover \\n\\namounts you owe us on this Agreement, to the extent permitted by law you agree to pay the \\n\\nreasonable fees of our attorneys who are not our regularly salaried employees, all fees paid to \\n\\nthird parties who collect on your debt for us, and all of our court, arbitration or other collection \\n\\ncharges. \\n\\n Check Return. If we issue Cash Advance Checks or drafts to you for use with your \\n\\nAccount, you agree that we need not return to you those that you use. If you need evidence of \\n\\nany payment made to a merchant or other person by a Cash Advance Check or draft, you agree \\n\\nthat a photocopy or similar reproduction we provide to you will be satisfactory for such \\n\\npurposes. Such copies are subject to the Copying Charges listed in the Our Charges section of \\n\\nthis Agreement. \\n\\n No Responsibility. We are not responsible in any way for the failure or refusal of any \\n\\nperson to honor a Card, Cash Advance Check or other credit instrument or device we supply to \\n\\nyou. We are not responsible if any ATM or other device fails to operate or operates improperly. \\n\\n Lost or Stolen Cards or Checks. You agree to notify us immediately if any Card or \\n\\nCash Advance Checks are lost or stolen, or if you suspect that they or your Account has been \\n\\nused, or may be used, without your permission. \\n\\nUnlawful Internet Gambling. Restricted transactions are prohibited from being \\n\\nprocessed through your account with us as required by the Unlawful Internet Gambling \\n\\nEnforcement Act of 2006 and Regulation GG. A restricted transaction is a transaction or \\n\\ntransmittal involving any credit, funds, instrument, or proceeds in connection with the \\n\\nparticipation of another person in unlawful internet gambling. \\n\\n Severability and Waiver. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or \\n\\nunenforceable under any law, rule or regulation, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability \\n\\nof any other provision of this Agreement. We may delay or waive enforcing any of our rights \\n\\nunder this Agreement without losing them. \\n\\n Changing This Agreement. We may change the terms of this Agreement at any time \\n\\nand from time to time and including, without limitation, by increasing existing annual or other \\n\\nfees, adding new fees, adding other new terms or deleting or modifying any existing terms. If \\n\\nwe change this Agreement, we will send you a prior notice of the change only if it is then \\n\\nrequired by law. To the extent permitted by law, a change in terms of this Agreement will apply \\n\\nto existing balances and new transactions on your Account.  \\n\\n Credit Information. If you believe that any information that we have furnished to \\n\\nconsumer reporting agencies about you and your Account is inaccurate, you should contact the \\n\\nconsumer reporting agency to ensure your rights. As permitted by law, we may obtain \\n\\nconsumer credit reports and information about you for updates, renewals, extensions of credit, \\n\\n\\n\\n 10 \\n\\nreview or collection of your Account and any other permissible purpose. We may furnish \\n\\ninformation about you and your Account to consumer reporting agencies and others who help \\n\\nservice your Account.  \\n\\n Governing Law. This Agreement and your Account will be governed by, and \\n\\ninterpreted under Federal law and the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to \\n\\nprinciples of conflict of laws. The legality, enforceability and interpretation of this \\n\\nAgreement and the amounts contracted for, charged and received under this Agreement \\n\\nwill be governed by such laws. This Agreement is entered into between you and us in \\n\\nDelaware. We make decisions about granting credit to you from and extend credit to you \\n\\nunder this Agreement in Delaware. Federal and Delaware law will also apply to any \\n\\ncontroversy, claim or dispute arising from or relating in any way to the subject matter of \\n\\nthis Agreement and/or your Account, including, without limitation, statutory, equitable or \\n\\ntort claims.  \\n\\n Return of Cards and Cash Advance Checks. You must surrender the Card(s) and \\n\\nCash Advance Checks to us upon demand. \\n\\n Binding Effect. If we pay a participating merchant for a Purchase or post a Cash \\n\\nAdvance to your Account before we receive written notice of your death or declaration of your \\n\\nlegal incompetence, or if we pay a participating merchant for a Purchase or post a Cash \\n\\nAdvance to your account for a transaction that you made prior to your death or the declaration \\n\\nof your legal incompetence, those transactions will be a valid and binding Account obligations \\n\\nupon you, your estate and your personal representatives. \\n\\n Foreign Exchange Rate. If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, MasterCard \\n\\nor Visa, depending on your card type, will convert the foreign currency transaction amount into \\n\\na U.S. dollar amount. MasterCard or Visa will act in accordance with their operating \\n\\nregulations or foreign currency conversion procedures then in effect. MasterCard currently uses \\n\\na conversion rate in effect one day prior to its transaction processing data. Such rate is either a \\n\\ngovernment-mandated rate or a wholesale rate. Visa currently uses a conversion rate in effect \\n\\non its central processing date. Such rate is either a rate it selects from the range of rates \\n\\navailable in wholesale currency markets, which may vary from the rate Visa receives or the \\n\\ngovernment mandated rate. We may impose a Foreign Currency Transaction Fee as described \\n\\nin the Interest Charges section of this Agreement.  \\n\\n Communications: 1) You are providing express written permission and consent \\n\\nauthorizing us or our agents to contact you at any phone number (including mobile, cellular, \\n\\nwireless, or similar devices) or email address you provide at any time, for any lawful purpose. \\n\\nThe ways in which we may contact you include live operator, automatic telephone dialing \\n\\nsystems (auto-dialer), prerecorded message, text/SMS message or email.

Arbitration is a method of deciding disputes outside the court system. This \\n\\nArbitration Provision governs when and how any disputes you and we may have will be \\n\\narbitrated instead of litigated in court. \\n\\n Certain Definitions. Certain capitalized words used in this Arbitration Provision have \\n\\nspecial meanings: \\n\\n “We,” “us,” and “our” do not mean just the Bank. These terms also include: (1) any \\n\\nparent company of the Bank, all companies owned by, controlled by or under common \\n\\nownership or control with the parent company or the Bank, including but not limited to Applied \\n\\nCard Systems, Inc.; (2) any prior issuer of the Account; (3) any company to which we transfer \\n\\nour rights under this Agreement; and (4) all of the employees or other individuals who manage \\n\\nor own these companies. Finally, if either you or we elect to arbitrate any Claim you bring \\n\\nagainst us, these terms include any other persons or companies who you make Claims against \\n\\nin the same proceeding. \\n\\n “Claim” means any dispute between you and us that cannot be resolved without a  \\n\\njudicial or arbitration proceeding and arises as a result of, or has anything at all to do with: (1) \\n\\nyour Account; (2) the events leading up to your becoming an Account holder; (3) this \\n\\nAgreement (including this Arbitration Provision); (4) any prior credit account or agreement \\n\\nrelating to such account; or (5) your relationship with us. This includes disputes relating to any \\n\\nproducts, insurance or other services offered to you as an Account holder. This includes \\n\\ndisputes about whether this Arbitration Provision is valid or binding; about whether or when it \\n\\napplies; and whether a dispute is arbitrable. It includes disputes relating to constitutional \\n\\n\\n\\n 12 \\n\\nprovisions; statutes; ordinances; regulations; court decisions; compliance with the Agreement \\n\\nor a related contract; and wrongful acts of every type (whether intentional; fraudulent; reckless; \\n\\nor just negligent). It includes requests for money, for orders requiring you or us to take certain \\n\\nactions (which are sometimes referred to as “injunctive relief”), for declarations of legal rights \\n\\nand for any other kind of relief. This Arbitration Provision applies to Claims that arise prior to \\n\\nthe effective date of this Arbitration Provision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dispute \\n\\nconcerning the validity or effect of the part of this Arbitration Provision captioned “NO CLASS \\n\\nACTIONS OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS” shall not be subject to this Arbitration Provision \\n\\nand shall be resolved by a court and not an arbitrator. \\n\\n “Administrator” means the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), 335 Madison \\n\\nAvenue, New York, NY 10017, www.adr.org, or, in the event that AAA is not available as a \\n\\nforum for arbitration of a Claim, such alternative forum which administrates arbitration of a \\n\\nClaim in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§1 et seq. and the \\n\\nAdministrator’s Rules. The arbitrator will be selected under the Administrator’s Rules. You can \\n\\nselect the arbitrator if you give us written notice of your selection with your notice that you are \\n\\nelecting to arbitrate any Claim or within 20 days after we give you notice that we are electing to \\n\\narbitrate any Claim. If you do not select the arbitrator  on time, we will select one. If for any \\n\\nreason the arbitrator you or we select is unable or unwilling to serve or continue to serve as \\n\\narbitrator , you will have 20 days to select a different arbitrator. \\n\\n Starting an Arbitration. You or we can give written notice of an intention to begin \\n\\narbitration of a Claim or Claims or to require arbitration of the other party’s Claim or Claims. \\n\\nThis notice can be given by one party even if the other party has begun a lawsuit. If such a \\n\\nnotice is given, any Claim will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Provision and \\n\\nthe Administrator’s Rules that are in effect at the time the Claim is filed with the Administrator. \\n\\nThe arbitrator must be a lawyer with more than 10 years of experience or a retired judge, unless \\n\\nyou and we agree otherwise. A copy of the Claim form may be obtained from the \\n\\nAdministrator or from us. A party who has asserted a Claim in a lawsuit may still elect \\n\\narbitration with respect to any Claim that is later asserted in the same lawsuit by any other \\n\\nparty. All doubts about whether to arbitrate a Claim shall be resolved in favor of arbitration.  \\n\\n We will not elect to arbitrate an individual Claim that you bring against us in “small \\n\\nclaims” court (or the equivalent court in your state). However, we may elect to arbitrate a \\n\\n“small claims” court Claim that is later transferred, removed or appealed to any different court. \\n\\n \\n\\nIMPORTANT LIMITATIONS \\n\\n If you or we elect to arbitrate a Claim, neither you nor we will have the right to \\n\\npursue that Claim in court or have a jury decide the Claim. Also, the ability of a party to \\n\\nobtain information from the other party and to appeal, is more limited in an arbitration \\n\\nthan in a lawsuit. Other rights that you or we would have in court may also not be \\n\\navailable in arbitration. The fees charged by the administrator may be higher than the \\n\\nfees charged by a court.  \\n\\n \\n\\nNO CLASS ACTIONS OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS \\n\\n If you or we elect to arbitrate a Claim: (1) neither you nor anyone else on your \\n\\nbehalf can pursue that Claim in court or in an arbitration proceeding on a class-wide or \\n\\nrepresentative basis; and (2) Claims brought by or against one account holder (or joint \\n\\naccount holders) may not be brought together with Claims brought by or against any \\n\\n\\n\\n 13 \\n\\nother account holder. The arbitrator shall have no authority to hear or decide an \\n\\narbitration on a class-wide or representative basis. However, this prohibition against class \\n\\nactions is not applicable to cardholders residing in the State of California. \\n\\n  \\n\\nArbitration Location and Costs. Any arbitration hearing that you attend will take \\n\\nplace at a location reasonably convenient to your residence. In the event that you file a Claim \\n\\nagainst us and you cannot afford to pay the fees charged by the Administrator and the arbitrator \\n\\nor if you believe that such fees are too high, and you cannot obtain a fee waiver, we will \\n\\nconsider any reasonable written request by you for us to advance the fees. We will pay any fees \\n\\nor expenses we are required to pay by law. The arbitrator will decide who will be ultimately \\n\\nresponsible for paying those fees. In the event that you file a Claim against us, in no event will \\n\\nyou be required to reimburse us for any arbitration filing, administrative or hearing fees in an \\n\\namount greater than what your court costs would have been if the Claim had been resolved in a \\n\\nstate court with jurisdiction. In the event that we file a Claim against you, the arbitrator will \\n\\ndecide who is responsible for paying all costs for arbitrating the Claim.  \\n\\n Governing Law. This Agreement involves interstate commerce and this Arbitration \\n\\nProvision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§1 et seq. The \\n\\narbitrator must follow: (1) the FAA; (2) the substantive law, consistent with the FAA, related to \\n\\nany Claim; (3) statutes of limitations; and (4) claims of privilege recognized at law. Upon the \\n\\ntimely request of either party, the arbitrator must provide a brief written explanation of the \\n\\nbasis for the award. The arbitrator will determine the rules of procedure and evidence to apply, \\n\\nconsistent with the FAA, the Administrator’s Rules and this Arbitration Provision. The \\n\\narbitrator shall not apply federal, state or local rules of procedure and evidence or state or local \\n\\nlaws concerning arbitration proceedings.  \\n\\n Obtaining Information. After an arbitration has been started, in addition to a party’s \\n\\nright to obtain information from the other party under the Administrator’s Rules, either party \\n\\nmay request the arbitrator in writing to allow that party to obtain more information from the \\n\\nother party. A copy of such request must be provided to the other party. That party will then \\n\\nhave the chance to object in writing. The objection must be sent to the arbitrator and the other \\n\\nparty. The arbitrator will decide the issue, in his or her sole discretion. \\n\\n Effect of Arbitration Award. Any appropriate court may enter judgment upon the \\n\\narbitrator’s award. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding, except for any appeal \\n\\nright under the FAA and except for Claims that involve requests for monetary relief exceeding \\n\\n$100,000 or requests for injunctive or declaratory relief that could cost any party more than \\n\\n$100,000. For these large Claims, any party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel \\n\\nappointed by the Administrator. That panel will consider all over again any part of the initial \\n\\naward that any party asserts was incorrectly decided. The decision of the panel will be by \\n\\nmajority vote and will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. Unless \\n\\napplicable law provides otherwise, the fees charged by the Administrator, and the arbitrators \\n\\nfor such an appeal, are to be paid by the appealing party, regardless of who wins the appeal. \\n\\nHowever, we will consider any reasonable written request by you for us to pay such fees. All \\n\\nother provisions of this Arbitration Provision shall apply to any appeal to a three-arbitrator \\n\\npanel and any reference in this Arbitration Provision to a single arbitrator shall apply to the  \\n\\nthree-arbitrator panel. \\n\\n Continued Effect of Arbitration Provision. This Arbitration Provision governs, \\n\\nnotwithstanding any prior arbitration provision between you and us. This Arbitration Provision \\n\\n\\n\\n 14 \\n\\nwill remain in force no matter what happens to you or your Account. For example, it will \\n\\nremain in force even if: (1) your credit privileges are ended or put on hold; (2) you close your \\n\\nAccount; (3) you repay your entire Account balance; (4) we begin a lawsuit to collect amounts \\n\\nwe think you owe; or (5) you become bankrupt or insolvent or a bankruptcy or insolvency \\n\\nproceeding is begun, to the extent consistent with applicable bankruptcy law. If any portion of \\n\\nthis Arbitration Provision cannot be enforced for any reason, the rest of this Arbitration \\n\\nProvision will continue to apply. However, if the part of this Arbitration Provision captioned \\n\\n“NO CLASS ACTIONS OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS” is struck in a proceeding brought as \\n\\na class action or representative action, the entire Arbitration Provision (other than this sentence) \\n\\nshall be null and void in such proceeding, provided that we and you retain the right to contest \\n\\nthrough appeal or further available judicial proceedings any determination with respect to this \\n\\npart of the Arbitration Provision. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this \\n\\nArbitration Provision, on the one hand, and the Administrator’s Rules or other provisions of \\n\\nthis Agreement, on the other hand, this Arbitration Provision will govern. \\n\\n Rejection of Arbitration Provision. You may reject this Arbitration Provision, (and \\n\\nany prior arbitration provision between you and us) by sending us a notice (“Rejection Notice”) \\n\\nthat we receive within thirty (30) days after you open your Account. Any Rejection Notice \\n\\nmust include your name, address and telephone number and must be signed by you. You must \\n\\nmail your Rejection Notice or send it by messenger service (such as Federal Express) to us at \\n\\nour Legal Department at P.O. Box 15803, Wilmington, DE 19850 or to any bank branch. In the \\n\\nevent of any dispute concerning whether you have provided a timely Rejection Notice, you \\n\\nmust provide a signed receipt as confirmation. This is the only method you can use to reject this \\n\\nArbitration Provision. \\n\\n \\n\\nYOUR BILLING RIGHTS \\n\\nKEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE \\n\\nThis notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. \\n\\n \\n\\nWHAT TO DO IF YOU FIND A MISTAKE ON YOUR STATEMENT \\n\\nIf you think there is an error on your billing statement, write to us on a separate sheet at P.O. \\n\\nBox 17125, Wilmington, DE 19850-7125.  In your letter, give us the following information: \\n\\n• Account information: Your name and Account number. \\n\\n• Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. \\n\\n• Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe \\n\\nis wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. \\n\\nYou must contact us: \\n\\n• Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. \\n\\n• At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop \\n\\npayment on the amount you think is wrong. \\n\\nYou must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not \\n\\nrequired to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. \\n\\n \\n\\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER WE RECEIVE YOUR LETTER \\n\\nWhen we receive your letter, we must do two things: \\n\\n1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. \\n\\nWe will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. \\n\\n\\n\\n 15 \\n\\n2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to \\n\\nyou why we believe the bill is correct. \\n\\nWhile we investigate whether or not there has been an error: \\n\\n• We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. \\n\\n• The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you \\n\\ninterest on that amount. \\n\\n• While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of \\n\\nyour balance. \\n\\n• We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit access line. \\n\\nAfter we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: \\n\\n• If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest \\n\\nor other fees related to that amount. \\n\\n• If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, \\n\\nalong with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you \\n\\nowe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not \\n\\npay the amount we think you owe. \\n\\nIf you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within \\n\\n10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent \\n\\nwithout also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone \\n\\nto whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the \\n\\nmatter has been settled between us. \\n\\nIf we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount \\n\\nyou question even if your bill is correct. \\n\\n \\n\\nYOUR RIGHTS IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED \\n\\nWITH YOUR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES \\n\\nIf you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit \\n\\ncard, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may \\n\\nhave the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. \\n\\nTo use this right, all of the following must be true: \\n\\n1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your \\n\\ncurrent mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither \\n\\nof these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if \\n\\nwe own the company that sold you the goods or services.) \\n\\n2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash \\n\\nadvances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card Account do not qualify. \\n\\n3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. \\n\\nIf all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in \\n\\nwriting on a separate sheet at P.O. Box 17125, Wilmington, DE 19850-7125. \\n\\nWhile we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. \\n\\nAfter we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you \\n\\nowe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent. \\n\\nYOUR LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED \\n\\nUSE OF YOUR ACCOUNT \\n\\n You may be liable for unauthorized use of your Account. You will not be liable for \\n\\nunauthorized use that occurs after you notify us, orally or in writing, of the loss or theft, or \\n\\n\\n\\n 16 \\n\\npossible unauthorized use of your card, Cash Advance Checks, or your account.

The \\n\\namounts of these fees are listed in the “Schedule of Rates and Fees” enclosed with this \\n\\nAgreement. Such fees will be treated as Purchases on your Account. Our assessment of Late \\n\\nFees and Returned Payment Fees does not mean you are permitted to engage in conduct giving \\n\\nrise to these fees. In fact, you agree not to engage in such conduct. \\n\\n 1. Account Origination Fee. If your Account has an Account Origination Fee it will be \\n\\ncharged once your Account is opened and will appear on your first monthly statement (unless \\n\\notherwise noted on the “Schedule of Rates and Fees”). The Account Origination Fee is non-\\n\\nrefundable unless you notify us in writing that you wish to close your Account within 30 days \\n\\nof our providing the Statement on which the Account Origination Fee is billed and at the same \\n\\ntime, you pay your outstanding balance in full.  \\n\\n2. Annual Fee.  If your Account has an Annual Fee it will be billed each year (unless \\n\\notherwise noted on the “Schedule of Rates and Fees”) and it will be charged once your account \\n\\nis opened and will appear on your first monthly statement. Subsequent Annual Fees will be \\n\\ncharged annually on the anniversary Closing Date. The Annual Fee is non-refundable unless \\n\\nyou notify us in writing that you wish to close your Account within 30 days of our providing \\n\\nthe Statement on which the Annual Fee is billed and at the same time, you pay your outstanding \\n\\nbalance in full. If your account is closed by you or us, we will continue to charge the Annual \\n\\nFee until you pay your outstanding balance in full and terminate your Account relationship. \\n\\n 3. Monthly Maintenance Fee (MMF).  If your Account has a MMF it will be imposed \\n\\nfor each Billing Cycle or portion thereof your Account is open or has a balance (unless \\n\\notherwise noted on the “Schedule of Rates and Fees”). The MMF will be charged to your \\n\\nAccount on each Closing Date.  If your account is closed by you or us, we will continue to \\n\\ncharge the MMF until you pay your outstanding balance in full and terminate your Account \\n\\nrelationship. \\n\\n4. Copying Charges. If you request duplicates of any Statement, Cash Advance Check \\n\\nor other documents (except in connection with proper and timely written notice of a billing \\n\\nerror), we will charge you a fee for each copy we provide, unless applicable state law requires \\n\\nus to charge a lesser amount. This fee will be charged to your Account on the date that your \\n\\nrequest is processed. \\n\\n 5. Late Fee. We will charge a Late Fee if we do not receive your Minimum Payment by \\n\\nthe Payment Due Date shown on your Statement in accordance with any hour of receipt and \\n\\n\\n\\n 5 \\n\\nother payment instructions appearing on your Statement. This fee will be charged to your \\n\\nAccount on your Payment Due Date if your Minimum Payment is not received.   \\n\\n6. Returned Payment Fee. If any check, draft, or other payment method we allow, \\n\\nelectronic or otherwise, that is submitted as payment for sums owing on your Account, or for \\n\\nany other purpose, is returned unpaid or charged back to us for any reason, we will charge a \\n\\nReturned Payment Fee. This fee will be charged to your Account on the date that your returned \\n\\npayment is processed. \\n\\n 7. Reinstatement Fee. If you or we terminate credit privileges on your Account for any \\n\\nreason, at your request and in our sole discretion we may reinstate your Account privileges. To \\n\\nbe eligible for reinstatement you must resolve any Default to our satisfaction. If we reinstate \\n\\nyour Account, we will charge you a Reinstatement Fee on the date that your request is \\n\\nprocessed.  \\n\\n 8. Stop Payment Fee. If we stop payment on any Cash Advance Check or other Cash \\n\\nAdvance at your request, we will charge a Stop Payment Fee on the date that your request is \\n\\nprocessed. Stop Payment orders are permissible, subject to applicable law, by mail or by phone \\n\\non any Cash Advance Check that has not posted to your Account and is received at such time \\n\\nas to give the Bank a reasonable opportunity to act. To request a stop payment, you must \\n\\nprecisely identify the type of Cash Advance Check, the check number, date of Cash Advance \\n\\nCheck, the exact amount of the item, and the payee. However, at our option, and to the extent \\n\\nthat we are able, we may honor Stop Payment requests that do not identify the Cash Advance \\n\\nCheck with as great a degree of precision as that specified in the immediately preceding \\n\\nsentence. Only the person who initiated the Stop Payment may make a release of the Stop \\n\\nPayment request. Oral Stop Payment orders are binding for fourteen (14) days only, unless you \\n\\nconfirm the order in writing and we receive it within the fourteen-day period. When a Stop \\n\\nPayment request form is properly signed and returned, the order is effective for six (6) months \\n\\nafter the latest date the written confirmation is received, accepted, and recorded on your \\n\\nAccount, at which time it will automatically expire. The Bank will not be liable for any \\n\\nreasonable delay in accepting and recording a Stop Payment to your Account. \\n\\n 9. Additional Card Fee. After the initial Card has been issued for your Account, if you \\n\\nrequest and we agree to provide an additional Card to be issued in the name of an Authorized \\n\\nUser or you request and we agree to permit an Authorized User who accepts full contractual \\n\\nliability for the account, to be added to your Account, we will charge an Additional Card Fee \\n\\nfor the approval of your request and the issuance of another Card to your Account. This fee will \\n\\nbe charged to your Account on the date that your request is processed. \\n\\n 10. Replacement Card Fee. After a Card has been issued in your name, if you request \\n\\nand we agree to provide a replacement Card, we will charge a Replacement Card Fee for the \\n\\nCard’s replacement. This fee also applies to any Authorized User. This fee will be charged to \\n\\nyour Account on the date that your request is processed. \\n\\n 11. Automated Account Information Fee. We will charge you to access our \\n\\nautomated account information system through our toll free telephone number. The first two \\n\\ninquiries per Billing Cycle will not incur a charge. Thereafter, a fee for each separate Account \\n\\ninquiry you make through our automated account information system will be assessed. This \\n\\nfee(s) will be charged to your Account on the same day that you make your inquires. You will \\n\\nbe charged for each separate inquiry you make even if you make more than one inquiry during \\n\\nthe same call. This fee may also be referred and listed on your Statement as an “excessive \\n\\npinpoint transaction.” \\n\\n\\n\\n 6 \\n\\n 12. Fees for Optional Payments. If you choose and we allow you to make an \\n\\nexpedited payment by telephone with the assistance of one of our associates or agents to post to \\n\\nyour Account the same day or, if the payment is made or received after 5:00 p.m., we will \\n\\nassess a fee to your account on the date that your payment is initiated. \\n\\n 13. Miscellaneous Fees. If permitted by applicable law, we may charge you any \\n\\nreasonable fees for services rendered or for reimbursement of expenses, incurred in good faith \\n\\nby us or our agents in connection with your Account, or other reasonable fees in connection \\n\\nwith our administering, terminating or reinstating your Account. For example, if you continue \\n\\nto use the Account after we advise you that your credit privileges have been terminated, we \\n\\nmay charge you for any fee imposed on recapture of the Card(s) or Cash Advance Checks. \\n\\n Interest Charges. Your Account is subject to the following Interest Charges, which \\n\\nmay appear as either a Fee or Interest on your Statement: (1) a Cash Advance Fee, which is \\n\\nimposed on the same day we honor any Cash Advance and added to your Cash Advance \\n\\nbalance (please note that in the Billing Cycle in which a Cash Advance is posted, the Cash \\n\\nAdvance Fee will cause the “Annual Percentage Rate” for Cash Advances to exceed the \\n\\n“Corresponding Annual Percentage Rate” for Cash Advances shown on your Statement for that \\n\\nBilling Cycle); (2) a “Periodic Rate Interest Charge,” which is calculated on the Purchase and \\n\\nCash Advance average daily balance of your Account as described in this Agreement. This \\n\\ncharge will be assessed to your Account on the Closing Date; (3) a “Credit Limit Increase Fee” \\n\\nwhich may be charged on the same day we approve each unsecured credit limit increase after \\n\\nyour Account is opened; (4) an “Upgrade Fee”, which may be charged on the same date we \\n\\napprove any product upgrade (i.e. standard to gold); (5) a “Foreign Currency Transaction Fee” \\n\\nis applied to any transaction made in a foreign currency that is converted to U. S. Dollars by \\n\\nVisa or MasterCard or any transaction made in a foreign country even if it is in U.S. Dollars \\n\\n(please note that this fee will be added on the same date to the same balance to which the \\n\\nforeign transaction is added); and (6) a “Minimum Interest Charge”, which will be charged for \\n\\na Billing Cycle during which there exists any Purchases and/or Cash Advances balance of $1 or \\n\\ngreater in your Account. \\n\\n Grace Period. There is no Grace Period for the Account. Interest Charges accrue on \\n\\nPurchases, Cash Advances and Our Charges beginning on the date the transaction occurs or on \\n\\nthe first day of the Billing Cycle in which the transaction is received by us or, at our option, the \\n\\ndate the transaction is posted to your Account. Periodic Rate Interest Charges continue to \\n\\naccrue until payment in full is received.  \\n\\n Periodic Rate Interest Charge Calculation-Average Daily Balance Method \\n\\n(Including New Transactions) for Purchases and Cash Advances. \\n\\n (1) To determine the Periodic Rate Interest Charge for Purchases and Cash Advances \\n\\nwe multiply the monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases and Cash Advances by the “average daily \\n\\nbalance” for Purchases and Cash Advances (including new transactions) for the current Billing \\n\\nCycle.  \\n\\n (2) The total Interest Charge imposed on your Account each Billing Cycle is the sum of \\n\\nthe Periodic Rate Interest Charges as calculated for Purchases and Cash Advances for the \\n\\ncurrent Billing Cycle, all Cash Advance Fees, and any Fees described in the Our Charges \\n\\nsection of this agreement that may be imposed during such Billing Cycle.  \\n\\n (3) Purchases. To get the “average daily balance” of Purchases for a Billing Cycle, we \\n\\ntake the beginning balance of Purchases in your Account each day, add any new Purchases, and \\n\\nsubtract any payments or credits which are applied to Purchases (treating any negative balances \\n\\n\\n\\n 7 \\n\\nas zero). On the first day of each Billing Cycle, we add the unpaid Periodic Rate Interest \\n\\nCharges for Purchases for the prior Billing Cycle to the daily balance of Purchases. (In this \\n\\nway, we compound Interest Charges on Purchases on your Account on a monthly basis.) This \\n\\ngives us the daily balance of Purchases. Then, we add up all the daily balances of Purchases for \\n\\nthe Billing Cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us \\n\\nthe “average daily balance” of Purchases for a Billing Cycle. There is no grace period in which \\n\\nPurchases may be repaid without incurring an Interest Charge.  \\n\\n (4) Cash Advances. To get the “average daily balance” of Cash Advances for a Billing \\n\\nCycle, we take the beginning balance of Cash Advances in your Account each day, add any \\n\\nnew Cash Advances, and subtract any payments or credits which are applied to Cash Advances \\n\\n(treating any negative balances as zero). On the first day of each Billing Cycle, we add the \\n\\nunpaid Periodic Rate Interest Charges for Cash Advances for the prior Billing Cycle to the \\n\\ndaily balance of Cash Advances. (In this way, we compound Interest Charges on Cash \\n\\nAdvances on your Account on a monthly basis.) This gives us the daily balance of Cash \\n\\nAdvances. Then, we add up all the daily balances of Cash Advances for the Billing Cycle and \\n\\ndivide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the “average daily \\n\\nbalance” of Cash Advances for a Billing Cycle. There is no grace period in which Cash \\n\\nAdvances may be repaid without incurring an Interest Charge.  \\n\\n (5) General Periodic Rates. See “Schedule of Rates and Fees” enclosed with this \\n\\nAgreement.  \\n\\nCredit Availability. If payments on your account are made by guaranteed funds (for \\n\\nexample, money orders and cashier’s checks), your credit availability will be increased on the \\n\\nday after your deposit or payment is credited. All other deposits or payments may not increase \\n\\nyour credit availability until we are assured that the payment has not been dishonored. This \\n\\ncould take up to 14 calendar days (or longer). \\n\\n Minimum Payments. You may pay your entire balance at any time, without penalty or \\n\\npremium. Whenever a balance is due, however, each month you must pay us at least the \\n\\nMinimum Payment Due, which we must receive on or before the Payment Due Date shown on \\n\\nthe Statement, in accordance with any hour of receipt and other payment instructions shown on \\n\\nyour monthly Statement. The Payment Due Date will be approximately 25 days after the \\n\\nClosing Date. The Minimum Payment Due in any monthly Billing Cycle will be equal to the \\n\\nsum of (i) 2.25% of your New Balance plus the total of all Periodic Rate Interest Charges that \\n\\nhave accrued in the Billing Cycle for which the Minimum Payment is being calculated \\n\\n(rounded up to the next dollar) or $35, whichever is more (or your entire New Balance if less \\n\\nthan $35); plus (ii) all past due amounts; plus (iii) the amount of any Late Fee charged in the \\n\\nBilling Cycle for which the Minimum Payment is being calculated. \\n\\n Subject to applicable law, we will apply and allocate payment up to the Minimum \\n\\nPayment Due and any credits on your Account among balances and Charges in any order and \\n\\nmanner determined by us in our sole discretion. You agree that we have the unconditional right \\n\\nto exercise this discretion in a way that is most favorable or convenient to us. Generally, the \\n\\namount of payments credited to your Account during a Billing Cycle will be applied first to the \\n\\nbalance bearing the lowest APR and then to balances bearing the higher APR, until the \\n\\nMinimum Payment Due payable in the Billing Cycle is credited to your Account. After that, the \\n\\namount of payments remaining will be applied to the balance bearing the highest APR and then \\n\\nto balances bearing the lower APR in descending order. In most cases, credits will be applied \\n\\nfirst to the balance from which the corresponding debit originated. \\n\\n\\n\\n 8 \\n\\n Security. You grant us a security interest and pledge and assign to us any and all sums \\n\\nnow or later in any Deposit established by you to secure payment of all of your existing and \\n\\nfuture obligations under this Agreement and your Account. The Deposit must be maintained \\n\\nwith us unencumbered (i.e. not subject to any lien, judgment, attachment or execution) at all \\n\\ntimes. You may add to the Deposit at any time. With our consent, you may also withdraw from \\n\\nthe Deposit, which will reduce your Credit Limit by a like amount, so long as you do not cause \\n\\nthe outstanding balance in the Account to exceed your new, lower Credit Limit. You agree that \\n\\nwe may restrict your right to obtain withdrawals from the Deposit. Upon a Default and without \\n\\nnotice to you, we may apply any sums then in the Deposit against what you then owe on your \\n\\nAccount. We may retain the Deposit or any sums remaining in the Deposit until the latest of the \\n\\nfollowing events: (i) 14 days after the time all sums owed to us on your Account are paid in \\n\\nfull, (ii) 10 weeks from the time we receive from you all of the unexpired Cards and Cash \\n\\nAdvance Checks, cut in half, or (iii) 10 weeks from the time of termination of your Account. \\n\\nExcept for the Deposit, we do not have a security interest in any other of your property in \\n\\nconnection with your Account. \\n\\n Terminating Credit Privileges and Closing Your Account. You or we can terminate \\n\\nyour credit privileges at any time for any reason, including but not limited to when you are in \\n\\nDefault under this Agreement. If you or we terminate your credit privileges, you promise that \\n\\nany amounts that you owe us at the time of termination, plus any new Purchases or Cash \\n\\nAdvances, plus any Interest Charges and other fees and charges that will continue to be \\n\\nimposed at the rates and in the amounts specified in this Agreement, will be repaid according to \\n\\nthis Agreement.  \\n\\n You may Close your Account at any time. In order to close your Account, you must: \\n\\ngive us written notice of your intent to close your Account at the address for inquiries shown on \\n\\nyour Statement, and pay your outstanding balance in full. Your notice to close your Account \\n\\nwill become effective as soon as we can reasonably act on it. If you request to close your \\n\\nAccount, but do not pay your outstanding balance in full, your credit privileges will be \\n\\nterminated. If you close your account, the terms of this Agreement remain in effect. \\n\\nDefault. You will be in default of this Agreement (“Default”) if any of the following \\n\\noccur:  \\n\\n  1. You do not make a Minimum Payment on your Account on or before the \\n\\nPayment Due Date; \\n\\n  2. You die or are declared legally incompetent; \\n\\n  3. You become insolvent or bankrupt; \\n\\n  4. You exceed or attempt to exceed the Credit Limit; \\n\\n  5. You provide us with false or misleading information or signatures at any time \\n\\nor use your Account in any fraudulent or unlawful manner; \\n\\n  6. You fail to comply with this Agreement; \\n\\n  7. You fail to make any payment or perform any promise in any other agreement \\n\\nor obligation you have with us; or  \\n\\n  8. Any judgment, lien, attachment or execution is issued against you, the \\n\\nDeposit or your other property. \\n\\n If you are in Default, we may immediately terminate your credit privileges on your \\n\\nAccount and any other credit account(s) you may have with us. We need not give you notice of \\n\\ntermination. We may also demand that you immediately pay us all sums owing on your \\n\\nAccount and any other credit account(s) you may have with us, including all unpaid Interest \\n\\n\\n\\n 9 \\n\\nCharges and other charges. We may also combine the outstanding balance on your Account \\n\\nwith the balances of any other credit account(s) you may have with us regardless of whether or \\n\\nnot that account is past due. Without notice to you, we may also apply any sums then in the \\n\\nDeposit, including interest, if any, you earned on the Deposit, against what you then owe on \\n\\nyour Account. We may also demand that you cut the Card(s) and Cash Advance Checks in half \\n\\nand immediately return them to us. Although we may have declared your Account to be in \\n\\nDefault, you agree to pay us Interest Charges and other charges at the rates provided in this \\n\\nAgreement until all sums you owe us are paid in full, even if we have demanded that you make \\n\\nimmediate payment in full. \\n\\n If we waive a Default, we do not waive the right to declare the same or another event \\n\\noccurring later as a Default of your Account. If we start collection proceedings to recover \\n\\namounts you owe us on this Agreement, to the extent permitted by law you agree to pay the \\n\\nreasonable fees of our attorneys who are not our regularly salaried employees, all fees paid to \\n\\nthird parties who collect on your debt for us, and all of our court, arbitration or other collection \\n\\ncharges. \\n\\n Check Return. If we issue Cash Advance Checks or drafts to you for use with your \\n\\nAccount, you agree that we need not return to you those that you use. If you need evidence of \\n\\nany payment made to a merchant or other person by a Cash Advance Check or draft, you agree \\n\\nthat a photocopy or similar reproduction we provide to you will be satisfactory for such \\n\\npurposes. Such copies are subject to the Copying Charges listed in the Our Charges section of \\n\\nthis Agreement. \\n\\n No Responsibility. We are not responsible in any way for the failure or refusal of any \\n\\nperson to honor a Card, Cash Advance Check or other credit instrument or device we supply to \\n\\nyou. We are not responsible if any ATM or other device fails to operate or operates improperly. \\n\\n Lost or Stolen Cards or Checks. You agree to notify us immediately if any Card or \\n\\nCash Advance Checks are lost or stolen, or if you suspect that they or your Account has been \\n\\nused, or may be used, without your permission. \\n\\nUnlawful Internet Gambling. Restricted transactions are prohibited from being \\n\\nprocessed through your account with us as required by the Unlawful Internet Gambling \\n\\nEnforcement Act of 2006 and Regulation GG. A restricted transaction is a transaction or \\n\\ntransmittal involving any credit, funds, instrument, or proceeds in connection with the \\n\\nparticipation of another person in unlawful internet gambling. \\n\\n Severability and Waiver. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or \\n\\nunenforceable under any law, rule or regulation, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability \\n\\nof any other provision of this Agreement. We may delay or waive enforcing any of our rights \\n\\nunder this Agreement without losing them. \\n\\n Changing This Agreement. We may change the terms of this Agreement at any time \\n\\nand from time to time and including, without limitation, by increasing existing annual or other \\n\\nfees, adding new fees, adding other new terms or deleting or modifying any existing terms. If \\n\\nwe change this Agreement, we will send you a prior notice of the change only if it is then \\n\\nrequired by law. To the extent permitted by law, a change in terms of this Agreement will apply \\n\\nto existing balances and new transactions on your Account.  \\n\\n Credit Information. If you believe that any information that we have furnished to \\n\\nconsumer reporting agencies about you and your Account is inaccurate, you should contact the \\n\\nconsumer reporting agency to ensure your rights. As permitted by law, we may obtain \\n\\nconsumer credit reports and information about you for updates, renewals, extensions of credit, \\n\\n\\n\\n 10 \\n\\nreview or collection of your Account and any other permissible purpose. We may furnish \\n\\ninformation about you and your Account to consumer reporting agencies and others who help \\n\\nservice your Account.  \\n\\n Governing Law. This Agreement and your Account will be governed by, and \\n\\ninterpreted under Federal law and the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to \\n\\nprinciples of conflict of laws. The legality, enforceability and interpretation of this \\n\\nAgreement and the amounts contracted for, charged and received under this Agreement \\n\\nwill be governed by such laws. This Agreement is entered into between you and us in \\n\\nDelaware. We make decisions about granting credit to you from and extend credit to you \\n\\nunder this Agreement in Delaware. Federal and Delaware law will also apply to any \\n\\ncontroversy, claim or dispute arising from or relating in any way to the subject matter of \\n\\nthis Agreement and/or your Account, including, without limitation, statutory, equitable or \\n\\ntort claims.  \\n\\n Return of Cards and Cash Advance Checks. You must surrender the Card(s) and \\n\\nCash Advance Checks to us upon demand. \\n\\n Binding Effect. If we pay a participating merchant for a Purchase or post a Cash \\n\\nAdvance to your Account before we receive written notice of your death or declaration of your \\n\\nlegal incompetence, or if we pay a participating merchant for a Purchase or post a Cash \\n\\nAdvance to your account for a transaction that you made prior to your death or the declaration \\n\\nof your legal incompetence, those transactions will be a valid and binding Account obligations \\n\\nupon you, your estate and your personal representatives. \\n\\n Foreign Exchange Rate. If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, MasterCard \\n\\nor Visa, depending on your card type, will convert the foreign currency transaction amount into \\n\\na U.S. dollar amount. MasterCard or Visa will act in accordance with their operating \\n\\nregulations or foreign currency conversion procedures then in effect. MasterCard currently uses \\n\\na conversion rate in effect one day prior to its transaction processing data. Such rate is either a \\n\\ngovernment-mandated rate or a wholesale rate. Visa currently uses a conversion rate in effect \\n\\non its central processing date. Such rate is either a rate it selects from the range of rates \\n\\navailable in wholesale currency markets, which may vary from the rate Visa receives or the \\n\\ngovernment mandated rate. We may impose a Foreign Currency Transaction Fee as described \\n\\nin the Interest Charges section of this Agreement.  \\n\\n Communications: 1) You are providing express written permission and consent \\n\\nauthorizing us or our agents to contact you at any phone number (including mobile, cellular, \\n\\nwireless, or similar devices) or email address you provide at any time, for any lawful purpose. \\n\\nThe ways in which we may contact you include live operator, automatic telephone dialing \\n\\nsystems (auto-dialer), prerecorded message, text/SMS message or email.

Arbitration is a method of deciding disputes outside the court system. This \\n\\nArbitration Provision governs when and how any disputes you and we may have will be \\n\\narbitrated instead of litigated in court. \\n\\n Certain Definitions. Certain capitalized words used in this Arbitration Provision have \\n\\nspecial meanings: \\n\\n “We,” “us,” and “our” do not mean just the Bank. These terms also include: (1) any \\n\\nparent company of the Bank, all companies owned by, controlled by or under common \\n\\nownership or control with the parent company or the Bank, including but not limited to Applied \\n\\nCard Systems, Inc.; (2) any prior issuer of the Account; (3) any company to which we transfer \\n\\nour rights under this Agreement; and (4) all of the employees or other individuals who manage \\n\\nor own these companies. Finally, if either you or we elect to arbitrate any Claim you bring \\n\\nagainst us, these terms include any other persons or companies who you make Claims against \\n\\nin the same proceeding. \\n\\n “Claim” means any dispute between you and us that cannot be resolved without a  \\n\\njudicial or arbitration proceeding and arises as a result of, or has anything at all to do with: (1) \\n\\nyour Account; (2) the events leading up to your becoming an Account holder; (3) this \\n\\nAgreement (including this Arbitration Provision); (4) any prior credit account or agreement \\n\\nrelating to such account; or (5) your relationship with us. This includes disputes relating to any \\n\\nproducts, insurance or other services offered to you as an Account holder. This includes \\n\\ndisputes about whether this Arbitration Provision is valid or binding; about whether or when it \\n\\napplies; and whether a dispute is arbitrable. It includes disputes relating to constitutional \\n\\n\\n\\n 12 \\n\\nprovisions; statutes; ordinances; regulations; court decisions; compliance with the Agreement \\n\\nor a related contract; and wrongful acts of every type (whether intentional; fraudulent; reckless; \\n\\nor just negligent). It includes requests for money, for orders requiring you or us to take certain \\n\\nactions (which are sometimes referred to as “injunctive relief”), for declarations of legal rights \\n\\nand for any other kind of relief. This Arbitration Provision applies to Claims that arise prior to \\n\\nthe effective date of this Arbitration Provision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dispute \\n\\nconcerning the validity or effect of the part of this Arbitration Provision captioned “NO CLASS \\n\\nACTIONS OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS” shall not be subject to this Arbitration Provision \\n\\nand shall be resolved by a court and not an arbitrator. \\n\\n “Administrator” means the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), 335 Madison \\n\\nAvenue, New York, NY 10017, www.adr.org, or, in the event that AAA is not available as a \\n\\nforum for arbitration of a Claim, such alternative forum which administrates arbitration of a \\n\\nClaim in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§1 et seq. and the \\n\\nAdministrator’s Rules. The arbitrator will be selected under the Administrator’s Rules. You can \\n\\nselect the arbitrator if you give us written notice of your selection with your notice that you are \\n\\nelecting to arbitrate any Claim or within 20 days after we give you notice that we are electing to \\n\\narbitrate any Claim. If you do not select the arbitrator  on time, we will select one. If for any \\n\\nreason the arbitrator you or we select is unable or unwilling to serve or continue to serve as \\n\\narbitrator , you will have 20 days to select a different arbitrator. \\n\\n Starting an Arbitration. You or we can give written notice of an intention to begin \\n\\narbitration of a Claim or Claims or to require arbitration of the other party’s Claim or Claims. \\n\\nThis notice can be given by one party even if the other party has begun a lawsuit. If such a \\n\\nnotice is given, any Claim will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Provision and \\n\\nthe Administrator’s Rules that are in effect at the time the Claim is filed with the Administrator. \\n\\nThe arbitrator must be a lawyer with more than 10 years of experience or a retired judge, unless \\n\\nyou and we agree otherwise. A copy of the Claim form may be obtained from the \\n\\nAdministrator or from us. A party who has asserted a Claim in a lawsuit may still elect \\n\\narbitration with respect to any Claim that is later asserted in the same lawsuit by any other \\n\\nparty. All doubts about whether to arbitrate a Claim shall be resolved in favor of arbitration.  \\n\\n We will not elect to arbitrate an individual Claim that you bring against us in “small \\n\\nclaims” court (or the equivalent court in your state). However, we may elect to arbitrate a \\n\\n“small claims” court Claim that is later transferred, removed or appealed to any different court. \\n\\n \\n\\nIMPORTANT LIMITATIONS \\n\\n If you or we elect to arbitrate a Claim, neither you nor we will have the right to \\n\\npursue that Claim in court or have a jury decide the Claim. Also, the ability of a party to \\n\\nobtain information from the other party and to appeal, is more limited in an arbitration \\n\\nthan in a lawsuit. Other rights that you or we would have in court may also not be \\n\\navailable in arbitration. The fees charged by the administrator may be higher than the \\n\\nfees charged by a court.  \\n\\n \\n\\nNO CLASS ACTIONS OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS \\n\\n If you or we elect to arbitrate a Claim: (1) neither you nor anyone else on your \\n\\nbehalf can pursue that Claim in court or in an arbitration proceeding on a class-wide or \\n\\nrepresentative basis; and (2) Claims brought by or against one account holder (or joint \\n\\naccount holders) may not be brought together with Claims brought by or against any \\n\\n\\n\\n 13 \\n\\nother account holder. The arbitrator shall have no authority to hear or decide an \\n\\narbitration on a class-wide or representative basis. However, this prohibition against class \\n\\nactions is not applicable to cardholders residing in the State of California. \\n\\n  \\n\\nArbitration Location and Costs. Any arbitration hearing that you attend will take \\n\\nplace at a location reasonably convenient to your residence. In the event that you file a Claim \\n\\nagainst us and you cannot afford to pay the fees charged by the Administrator and the arbitrator \\n\\nor if you believe that such fees are too high, and you cannot obtain a fee waiver, we will \\n\\nconsider any reasonable written request by you for us to advance the fees. We will pay any fees \\n\\nor expenses we are required to pay by law. The arbitrator will decide who will be ultimately \\n\\nresponsible for paying those fees. In the event that you file a Claim against us, in no event will \\n\\nyou be required to reimburse us for any arbitration filing, administrative or hearing fees in an \\n\\namount greater than what your court costs would have been if the Claim had been resolved in a \\n\\nstate court with jurisdiction. In the event that we file a Claim against you, the arbitrator will \\n\\ndecide who is responsible for paying all costs for arbitrating the Claim.  \\n\\n Governing Law. This Agreement involves interstate commerce and this Arbitration \\n\\nProvision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§1 et seq. The \\n\\narbitrator must follow: (1) the FAA; (2) the substantive law, consistent with the FAA, related to \\n\\nany Claim; (3) statutes of limitations; and (4) claims of privilege recognized at law. Upon the \\n\\ntimely request of either party, the arbitrator must provide a brief written explanation of the \\n\\nbasis for the award. The arbitrator will determine the rules of procedure and evidence to apply, \\n\\nconsistent with the FAA, the Administrator’s Rules and this Arbitration Provision. The \\n\\narbitrator shall not apply federal, state or local rules of procedure and evidence or state or local \\n\\nlaws concerning arbitration proceedings.  \\n\\n Obtaining Information. After an arbitration has been started, in addition to a party’s \\n\\nright to obtain information from the other party under the Administrator’s Rules, either party \\n\\nmay request the arbitrator in writing to allow that party to obtain more information from the \\n\\nother party. A copy of such request must be provided to the other party. That party will then \\n\\nhave the chance to object in writing. The objection must be sent to the arbitrator and the other \\n\\nparty. The arbitrator will decide the issue, in his or her sole discretion. \\n\\n Effect of Arbitration Award. Any appropriate court may enter judgment upon the \\n\\narbitrator’s award. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding, except for any appeal \\n\\nright under the FAA and except for Claims that involve requests for monetary relief exceeding \\n\\n$100,000 or requests for injunctive or declaratory relief that could cost any party more than \\n\\n$100,000. For these large Claims, any party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel \\n\\nappointed by the Administrator. That panel will consider all over again any part of the initial \\n\\naward that any party asserts was incorrectly decided. The decision of the panel will be by \\n\\nmajority vote and will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. Unless \\n\\napplicable law provides otherwise, the fees charged by the Administrator, and the arbitrators \\n\\nfor such an appeal, are to be paid by the appealing party, regardless of who wins the appeal. \\n\\nHowever, we will consider any reasonable written request by you for us to pay such fees. All \\n\\nother provisions of this Arbitration Provision shall apply to any appeal to a three-arbitrator \\n\\npanel and any reference in this Arbitration Provision to a single arbitrator shall apply to the  \\n\\nthree-arbitrator panel. \\n\\n Continued Effect of Arbitration Provision. This Arbitration Provision governs, \\n\\nnotwithstanding any prior arbitration provision between you and us. This Arbitration Provision \\n\\n\\n\\n 14 \\n\\nwill remain in force no matter what happens to you or your Account. For example, it will \\n\\nremain in force even if: (1) your credit privileges are ended or put on hold; (2) you close your \\n\\nAccount; (3) you repay your entire Account balance; (4) we begin a lawsuit to collect amounts \\n\\nwe think you owe; or (5) you become bankrupt or insolvent or a bankruptcy or insolvency \\n\\nproceeding is begun, to the extent consistent with applicable bankruptcy law. If any portion of \\n\\nthis Arbitration Provision cannot be enforced for any reason, the rest of this Arbitration \\n\\nProvision will continue to apply. However, if the part of this Arbitration Provision captioned \\n\\n“NO CLASS ACTIONS OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS” is struck in a proceeding brought as \\n\\na class action or representative action, the entire Arbitration Provision (other than this sentence) \\n\\nshall be null and void in such proceeding, provided that we and you retain the right to contest \\n\\nthrough appeal or further available judicial proceedings any determination with respect to this \\n\\npart of the Arbitration Provision. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this \\n\\nArbitration Provision, on the one hand, and the Administrator’s Rules or other provisions of \\n\\nthis Agreement, on the other hand, this Arbitration Provision will govern. \\n\\n Rejection of Arbitration Provision. You may reject this Arbitration Provision, (and \\n\\nany prior arbitration provision between you and us) by sending us a notice (“Rejection Notice”) \\n\\nthat we receive within thirty (30) days after you open your Account. Any Rejection Notice \\n\\nmust include your name, address and telephone number and must be signed by you. You must \\n\\nmail your Rejection Notice or send it by messenger service (such as Federal Express) to us at \\n\\nour Legal Department at P.O. Box 15803, Wilmington, DE 19850 or to any bank branch. In the \\n\\nevent of any dispute concerning whether you have provided a timely Rejection Notice, you \\n\\nmust provide a signed receipt as confirmation. This is the only method you can use to reject this \\n\\nArbitration Provision. \\n\\n \\n\\nYOUR BILLING RIGHTS \\n\\nKEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE \\n\\nThis notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. \\n\\n \\n\\nWHAT TO DO IF YOU FIND A MISTAKE ON YOUR STATEMENT \\n\\nIf you think there is an error on your billing statement, write to us on a separate sheet at P.O. \\n\\nBox 17125, Wilmington, DE 19850-7125.  In your letter, give us the following information: \\n\\n• Account information: Your name and Account number. \\n\\n• Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. \\n\\n• Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe \\n\\nis wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. \\n\\nYou must contact us: \\n\\n• Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. \\n\\n• At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop \\n\\npayment on the amount you think is wrong. \\n\\nYou must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not \\n\\nrequired to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. \\n\\n \\n\\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER WE RECEIVE YOUR LETTER \\n\\nWhen we receive your letter, we must do two things: \\n\\n1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. \\n\\nWe will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. \\n\\n\\n\\n 15 \\n\\n2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to \\n\\nyou why we believe the bill is correct. \\n\\nWhile we investigate whether or not there has been an error: \\n\\n• We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. \\n\\n• The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you \\n\\ninterest on that amount. \\n\\n• While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of \\n\\nyour balance. \\n\\n• We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit access line. \\n\\nAfter we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: \\n\\n• If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest \\n\\nor other fees related to that amount. \\n\\n• If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, \\n\\nalong with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you \\n\\nowe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not \\n\\npay the amount we think you owe. \\n\\nIf you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within \\n\\n10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent \\n\\nwithout also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone \\n\\nto whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the \\n\\nmatter has been settled between us. \\n\\nIf we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount \\n\\nyou question even if your bill is correct. \\n\\n \\n\\nYOUR RIGHTS IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED \\n\\nWITH YOUR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES \\n\\nIf you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit \\n\\ncard, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may \\n\\nhave the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. \\n\\nTo use this right, all of the following must be true: \\n\\n1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your \\n\\ncurrent mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither \\n\\nof these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if \\n\\nwe own the company that sold you the goods or services.) \\n\\n2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash \\n\\nadvances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card Account do not qualify. \\n\\n3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. \\n\\nIf all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in \\n\\nwriting on a separate sheet at P.O. Box 17125, Wilmington, DE 19850-7125. \\n\\nWhile we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. \\n\\nAfter we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you \\n\\nowe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent. \\n\\nYOUR LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED \\n\\nUSE OF YOUR ACCOUNT \\n\\n You may be liable for unauthorized use of your Account. You will not be liable for \\n\\nunauthorized use that occurs after you notify us, orally or in writing, of the loss or theft, or \\n\\n\\n\\n 16 \\n\\npossible unauthorized use of your card, Cash Advance Checks, or your account.

The words \"you\" and \"your\" mean each \\nperson, each business or organization (\"organization\"), and each officer or owner of the organization who agrees \\nto be bound by this Agreement as set forth below. The words we, our, us and \"Credit Union\" means the Credit \\nUnion whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement. \\nThe word \"card\" means the MasterCard business credit card you receive from the Credit Union and any \\nduplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you. The word \"account\" means the credit card \\nline of credit account the Credit Union approves for you that is subject to this Agreement.  \\n \\n1. PERSONS BOUND.  By signing (in ink, electronically or digitally) any business loan application stating your \\nagreement to be bound by this Agreement or by using the card or account we issue to you, or by authorizing an \\nemployee to use the card or account we issue to you, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If \\nyou are an officer or owner obtaining an account for your organization, you agree to the terms of this Agreement \\nin your personal capacity as well as your capacity as an officer or owner authorized to bind the organization to this \\nAgreement. \\n \\n2. USING YOUR ACCOUNT.  If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit \\nfor you. The amount of your credit limit is set forth on the Addendum accompanying this Agreement. You agree \\nthat your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus \"other charges\") \\nthat you will have outstanding on your account at any time. If you exceed your credit limit, you must pay the \\namount you are over your limit plus any fees and unpaid finance charges before payments will begin to restore \\nyour credit limit. In addition, a fee may be imposed for exceeding your credit limit. You may request an increase in \\nyour credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease \\nyour credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not \\nprohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may from time to time issue \\nconvenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a \\npayment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check it will be posted to your account as a cash \\nadvance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and \\nsuch refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor.  \\n \\nYou may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any \\nfee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment \\nrequest orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the \\npresentment of the check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your \\nrequest must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number \\nthat may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. You may make a stop payment request orally but \\nsuch a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop \\npayment orders are effective only for six (6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by \\nrequesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop \\npayment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop \\npayment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your \\nrights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. You agree to \\nindemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney\\'s fees, damages, or claims, \\nrelated to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect \\ninformation provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request. \\n\\n \\n3. STATEMENT OF BUSINESS PURPOSE. You agree that you have represented to us that you are obtaining \\nyour account for business purposes that all purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of any \\nconvenience checks issued on your account and any other use of your account will only be for a business \\npurpose. You agree that you will never use your account for any personal, household or family purposes. \\n\\n \\n4. USING YOUR CARD.  You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept \\nyour card. The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your \\ncard. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number \\n\\n\\n\\nYPAAF0 (BXCM12)-e 2\\n\\nsecurity information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, the Credit Union may \\npermit you to obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions that accept your card, \\nand from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs may accept your card.) If the Credit Union \\nauthorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain \\ncash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN that is issued to you for use with your card. You agree that \\nyou will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state or local law. Even if you \\nuse your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection \\nwith the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to \\npurchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will \\nbe posted to your account as a cash advance and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers, money orders, \\nbets, lottery tickets, and casino gaming chips as applicable. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting \\nor authorizing any transaction that is illegal. \\n \\n5. RESPONSIBILITY.  You agree to pay all charges (purchases and cash advances, balance transfers, use of \\nconvenience checks and any other charge) to your account that are made by you or anyone whom you authorize \\nto use your account. You also agree to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under \\nthe terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If there is more than one \\nperson bound to this Agreement, each will be individually and jointly responsible for paying all amounts owed \\nunder this Agreement. If you are an organization, the officer or owner that obtained the account for the \\norganization is also personally obligated for all charges made under the account. This means that the \\nCredit Union can require any one of you to individually repay the entire amount owed under this Agreement. In \\naddition each person bound under this Agreement as well as any authorized user may make purchases \\nindividually and if cash advances are permitted for your account, may obtain cash advances individually. \\n \\n6. INTEREST RATE.  The Interest Rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are \\ndisclosed on the Addendum that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed is also \\ndisclosed on the Addendum. These rates may be either fixed or variable as disclosed in the Addendum \\naccompanying this Agreement. If the rate for your account is fixed, the rate charged on purchases, cash \\nadvances, balance transfers, and any penalty rate will be fixed and will not vary from month to month unless we \\nnotify you in advance that the rate will change. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the \\naccompanying Addendum, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty \\nrate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Addendum accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your \\naccount for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower \\nthan the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your \\naccount, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Addendum accompanying this \\nAgreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the Interest Rate will automatically increase to the rates \\nthat would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement. \\n \\n7. FINANCE CHARGE CALCULATION METHOD FOR PURCHASES.  New purchases posted to your account \\nduring a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle. Finance charges begin to accrue on \\nthose purchases from the first day of the next billing cycle, unless you paid the entire New Balance on the \\nprevious cycle’s billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance \\ncharge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire New Balance on the billing statement by the \\nPayment Due Date of that statement. The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash \\nadvances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily \\nbalance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance \\nof purchases each day and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the purchase balance. (We do \\nnot add in any purchases posted during the billing cycle.) This gives us the daily balance of purchases. Then, we \\nadd all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in \\nthe billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases. \\n \\n8. FINANCE CHARGE CALCULATION METHOD FOR CASH ADVANCES.  A finance charge begins to accrue \\non cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the \\ncash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance \\nof cash advances, you must pay the entire New Balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that \\nstatement. For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily \\nbalance of cash advances. To get the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning \\noutstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments \\nand/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. \\nThen, we add all the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the \\nnumber of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. \\n\\n\\n\\nYPAAF0 (BXCM12)-e 3\\n\\n9. OTHER CHARGES.  In addition to the Interest Rate, additional fees may be imposed on your account. The \\namount and description of these fees are disclosed on the Addendum accompanying this Agreement. \\n  \\n10. PAYMENTS.  Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date \\nspecified on the statement or no later than twenty-five (25) days from the statement closing date, whichever is \\nlater.

All payments must be made in U.S. dollars and if made by a negotiable \\ninstrument such as a check or money order, must be in a form acceptable to us and drawn on a U.S. financial \\ninstitution. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the Total New Balance in \\nfull. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each \\nmonth your account has a balance (other than a credit balance).

FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS. If you make a purchase or obtain a cash advance in a foreign currency, the \\ntransaction will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. MasterCard will convert the transaction into U.S. \\ndollars depending on whether you complete the transaction with a MasterCard or if the transaction is processed \\nby a network operated or affiliated with MasterCard. For transactions processed through MasterCard, the \\nexchange rate used to convert foreign currency transactions to U.S. dollars is either a government-mandated \\nexchange rate or a wholesale exchange rate that is selected by MasterCard. The rate MasterCard uses for a \\nparticular transaction is the rate MasterCard selects for the applicable currency on the day the transaction is \\nprocessed. The exchange rate used to convert the transaction may differ from the rate MasterCard receives and \\nmay differ from the rate applicable on the date the transaction occurred or was posted to your account.  \\n \\n12.

In addition, your account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with \\nthe Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement account or in any other account that would lose \\nspecial tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless \\nyou are in default under this Agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or \\njoint share accounts to pay any amounts due on your account if you should default. Collateral securing other \\nloans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as \\nsecurity for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement.  \\n \\n14.

When you are in default, the Credit \\nUnion has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If \\nimmediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges, at the applicable interest rate, \\nuntil what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied \\ntowards what you owe.  \\n \\n15.

You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the \\ntransactions were unauthorized.   \\n \\nThe card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the \\nCredit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the credit union.

The Account Opening Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit Card Agreement \\nand is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words \"you,\" “your,” and \"yours\" mean each and all of those who \\nagree to be bound by this Agreement; \"card\" means the MasterCard credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or \\nsubstitutions the Credit Union issues to you; \"account\" means your MasterCard credit card line-of-credit account with the \\nCredit Union; and \"Credit Union\" means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the \\nCredit Union transfers this Agreement. \\n\\n1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. \\nYou agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus \"other \\ncharges\") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. Unless disclosed otherwise, the Credit Union will \\nnot allow advances over the credit limit. If the Credit Union has a program whereby it allows payment of advances that \\nexceed your credit limit, subject to a fee, the Credit Union will provide you with notice, either orally, in writing, or \\nelectronically (notwithstanding the requirements of the paragraph entitled “Statements and Notices”) explaining your right \\nto opt in to the Credit Union’s program whereby it will honor advance requests over the credit limit. In the event you opt in \\nto such a program, you agree to the terms of such a program. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a \\nmethod acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an \\nadvance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain \\ncash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your \\naccount. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience \\ncheck, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check \\ndrawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. \\n\\nYou may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee \\nimposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request \\norally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the \\ncheck for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately \\ndescribe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the \\nexact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after \\n14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six \\nmonths and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be \\nrenewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a \\ncheck or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the \\npayee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any \\nlegal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney\\'s fees, \\ndamages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result \\nof incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request.  \\n\\n2. USING YOUR CARD — You understand that the use of your credit card or credit card account will constitute \\nacknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening \\nDisclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. \\nThe credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to \\npay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you \\nwill be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other \\nfinancial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your \\ncard.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number \\n(PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that \\nyou will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use \\nyour card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the \\ntransaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase \\ninstruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your \\naccount as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers and money orders. This paragraph shall not \\nbe interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n DPAVR1 (MXC503 CCM004)-e \\n\\n3. PROMISE TO PAY — You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of \\nconvenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You \\nalso promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or \\nanother agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also \\napplies to your account. \\n\\n4. PERIODIC RATES — The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are \\ndisclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a \\npayment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to \\napplicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on \\npurchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure \\naccompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory \\ndiscounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an \\nIntroductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure \\naccompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to \\nthe rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement.  \\n\\n5. FINANCE CHARGES — New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge \\nfor that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new \\nbalance on the previous cycle\\'s billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge \\nwill accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of \\npurchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A \\nfinance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the \\nbilling cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later (transaction date). \\n\\nThe finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is \\ncomputed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To calculate the average daily balance \\nof purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract \\nany payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. We then add all of the daily balances of \\npurchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the \\naverage daily balance of purchases. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as purchases. \\n\\nFor cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash \\nadvances. To calculate the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash \\nadvances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash \\nadvance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. We then add all of the daily balances of cash \\nadvances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the \\naverage daily balance of cash advances.  \\n\\n6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your \\naccount in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate used to convert foreign currency transactions to U.S. dollars is either a \\ngovernment-mandated exchange rate or a wholesale exchange rate and is selected by MasterCard. The rate MasterCard \\nuses for a particular transaction is the rate MasterCard selects for the applicable currency on the day the transaction is \\nprocessed. This rate may differ from the rate applicable on the date the transaction occurred or was posted to your \\naccount. \\n\\nA fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed outside of the United States, where the cardholder’s \\ncountry code differs from the merchant’s country code. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions \\ncompleted in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. \\ndollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure \\naccompanying this Agreement. \\n\\n7. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to \\nyour account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.

You may call us, but if you do we are not required to \\ninvestigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. \\n\\nWhat Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter \\n\\nWhen we receive your letter, we must do two things: \\n\\n 1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have \\nalready corrected the error. \\n\\n 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is \\ncorrect.  \\n\\nWhile we investigate whether or not there has been an error: \\n\\n - We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. \\n - The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. \\n - While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. \\n - We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.  \\n\\nAfter we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: \\n\\n - If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that \\namount. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n DPAVR1 (MXC503 CCM004)-e \\n\\n - If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable \\ninterest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then \\nreport you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.  \\n\\nIf you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still \\nrefuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. \\nWe must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know \\nwhen the matter has been settled between us. \\n\\nIf we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is \\ncorrect. \\n\\nYour Rights if You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases \\n\\nIf you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in \\ngood faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the \\npurchase. \\n\\nTo use this right, all of the following must be true: \\n\\n 1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the \\npurchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on \\nan advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) \\n\\n 2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a \\ncheck that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. \\n\\n 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. \\n\\nIf all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing or electronically at \\nthe address listed on your statement. \\n\\nWhile we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, \\nwe will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as \\ndelinquent. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n',\n",

The Account Opening Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit Card Agreement \\nand is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words \"you,\" “your,” and \"yours\" mean each and all of those who \\nagree to be bound by this Agreement; \"card\" means the MasterCard credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or \\nsubstitutions the Credit Union issues to you; \"account\" means your MasterCard credit card line-of-credit account with the \\nCredit Union; and \"Credit Union\" means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the \\nCredit Union transfers this Agreement. \\n\\n1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. \\nYou agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus \"other \\ncharges\") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. Unless disclosed otherwise, the Credit Union will \\nnot allow advances over the credit limit. If the Credit Union has a program whereby it allows payment of advances that \\nexceed your credit limit, subject to a fee, the Credit Union will provide you with notice, either orally, in writing, or \\nelectronically (notwithstanding the requirements of the paragraph entitled “Statements and Notices”) explaining your right \\nto opt in to the Credit Union’s program whereby it will honor advance requests over the credit limit. In the event you opt in \\nto such a program, you agree to the terms of such a program. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a \\nmethod acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an \\nadvance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain \\ncash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your \\naccount. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience \\ncheck, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check \\ndrawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. \\n\\nYou may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee \\nimposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request \\norally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the \\ncheck for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately \\ndescribe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the \\nexact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after \\n14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six \\nmonths and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be \\nrenewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a \\ncheck or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the \\npayee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any \\nlegal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney\\'s fees, \\ndamages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result \\nof incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request.  \\n\\n2. USING YOUR CARD — You understand that the use of your credit card or credit card account will constitute \\nacknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening \\nDisclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. \\nThe credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to \\npay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you \\nwill be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other \\nfinancial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your \\ncard.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number \\n(PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that \\nyou will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use \\nyour card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the \\ntransaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase \\ninstruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your \\naccount as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers and money orders. This paragraph shall not \\nbe interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n DPAVR1 (MXC503 CCM004)-e \\n\\n3. PROMISE TO PAY — You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of \\nconvenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You \\nalso promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or \\nanother agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also \\napplies to your account. \\n\\n4. PERIODIC RATES — The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are \\ndisclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a \\npayment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to \\napplicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on \\npurchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure \\naccompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory \\ndiscounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an \\nIntroductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure \\naccompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to \\nthe rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement.  \\n\\n5. FINANCE CHARGES — New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge \\nfor that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new \\nbalance on the previous cycle\\'s billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge \\nwill accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of \\npurchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A \\nfinance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the \\nbilling cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later (transaction date). \\n\\nThe finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is \\ncomputed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To calculate the average daily balance \\nof purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract \\nany payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. We then add all of the daily balances of \\npurchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the \\naverage daily balance of purchases. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as purchases. \\n\\nFor cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash \\nadvances. To calculate the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash \\nadvances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash \\nadvance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. We then add all of the daily balances of cash \\nadvances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the \\naverage daily balance of cash advances.  \\n\\n6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your \\naccount in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate used to convert foreign currency transactions to U.S. dollars is either a \\ngovernment-mandated exchange rate or a wholesale exchange rate and is selected by MasterCard. The rate MasterCard \\nuses for a particular transaction is the rate MasterCard selects for the applicable currency on the day the transaction is \\nprocessed. This rate may differ from the rate applicable on the date the transaction occurred or was posted to your \\naccount. \\n\\nA fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed outside of the United States, where the cardholder’s \\ncountry code differs from the merchant’s country code. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions \\ncompleted in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. \\ndollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure \\naccompanying this Agreement. \\n\\n7. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to \\nyour account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.

Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your \\naccount when a payment is returned for any reason. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n DPAVR1 (MXC503 CCM004)-e \\n\\ne. Returned Convenience Check Fee.

Document Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Document Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee \\nmay be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request (except when the request is \\nmade in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union). \\n\\nh.

You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new \\nbalance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each \\nmonth your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 2.00% of your total new \\nbalance, or $20.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, all \\noutstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit by the date specified on the \\nstatement. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your \\ncredit limit.

These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are \\nin default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint \\nshare accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default. \\n\\nCollateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never \\nbe considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement.  \\n\\n11.

You may call us, but if you do we are not required to \\ninvestigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. \\n\\nWhat Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter \\n\\nWhen we receive your letter, we must do two things: \\n\\n 1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have \\nalready corrected the error. \\n\\n 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is \\ncorrect.  \\n\\nWhile we investigate whether or not there has been an error: \\n\\n - We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. \\n - The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. \\n - While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. \\n - We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.  \\n\\nAfter we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: \\n\\n - If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that \\namount. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n DPAVR1 (MXC503 CCM004)-e \\n\\n - If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable \\ninterest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then \\nreport you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.  \\n\\nIf you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still \\nrefuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. \\nWe must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know \\nwhen the matter has been settled between us. \\n\\nIf we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is \\ncorrect. \\n\\nYour Rights if You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases \\n\\nIf you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in \\ngood faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the \\npurchase. \\n\\nTo use this right, all of the following must be true: \\n\\n 1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the \\npurchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on \\nan advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) \\n\\n 2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a \\ncheck that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. \\n\\n 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. \\n\\nIf all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing or electronically at \\nthe address listed on your statement. \\n\\nWhile we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, \\nwe will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as \\ndelinquent. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n'],\n",

If your Account is a \\n\\njoint Account, all of you are bound by this Agreement and each of you jointly and individually \\n\\npromises to pay all amounts owed to us for transactions made by any joint Account holder.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nMONTHLY STATEMENT.  We will send you a monthly statement for any billing period in which there \\n\\nis activity on your Account, or as otherwise required by applicable law.  Your monthly statement will \\n\\nshow, among other things, (1) the unpaid balance on your Account at the beginning of the billing \\n\\nperiod (the “New Balance”); (2) any Purchases, Advances, Balance Transfers, interest, fees and \\n\\nother debits posted to your Account in that billing period; (3) any payments and credits posted to your \\n\\nAccount in that billing period; and (4) the minimum payment you must pay and the date your minimum \\n\\npayment is due (approximately 25 days after the billing date on your monthly statement).  We will \\n\\nsend the monthly statement to the address specified on your Application or to the address you \\n\\ndesignate from time to time.     \\n\\n   \\n\\nPAYMENTS.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n1. Minimum Payment; Application of Payments.  You must pay at least the minimum payment \\n\\nshown on your monthly statement each billing period.  If the New Balance is more than $15, the \\n\\nminimum payment is $15 or 2.5% of the New Balance, whichever is greater.  The minimum payment \\n\\nwill be rounded up to the nearest dollar.  If the New Balance is less than $15, the total New Balance is \\n\\ndue.  Any amounts past due or in excess of your Credit Limit will also be added to the minimum \\n\\npayment.  Payment for more than the minimum amount due will be accepted as a single payment for \\n\\nthat month.  Any amount over the minimum is not applicable to future amounts due.  In accordance \\n\\nwith applicable law, we will choose the order in which payments are applied to your Account.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n2. Making Payments.  All payments must be in U.S. dollars.  All checks must be drawn on funds \\n\\non deposit in the United States.  Mail your payment to the address shown on your monthly statement.  \\n\\nYour payment will be credited as of the date of receipt by us only if received by 5:00 p.m. (Central \\n\\nStandard Time).  Any payments received after this time will be deemed received by us on the next \\n\\nbusiness day.  Payments made at any location other than the address shown on your monthly \\n\\nstatement could be subject to a delay in crediting.  With your payment, include your payment coupon, \\n\\nwhich is a portion of your monthly statement.  If you do not include your payment coupon, credit to \\n\\nyour Account may be delayed.  Delayed crediting may cause you to incur a Late Payment Fee or \\n\\n\\n\\n55793   \\n\\n   \\n\\nadditional interest.  Payments can also be made online at www.aboc.com or by phone at (844) 431-\\n\\n0820. Do not send us cash.     \\n\\n   \\n\\n3. Disputed Payments.  You agree not to send us payments marked “paid in full,” “without \\n\\nrecourse” or with similar language.  If you send such a payment, we may accept it without losing any \\n\\nof our rights under this Agreement.  All written communications concerning disputed amounts, \\n\\nincluding any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes “payment \\n\\nin full” of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction \\n\\nof a disputed amount, must be mailed or delivered to Amalgamated Bank of Chicago, P.O. Box \\n\\nA3979, Chicago, Illinois 60690 Attn: Credit Card Disputed Payments. You may also dispute payment \\n\\nby visiting our Online Banking website and searching for the transaction in question.    \\n\\n   \\n\\nOTHER FEES.  Subject to limitations and requirements of applicable law, you agree to pay the \\n\\nfollowing fees:   \\n\\n   \\n\\na. If applicable, an Annual Fee, which will be billed on your first monthly statement and thereafter \\n\\non the anniversary date of your Account until your Account is terminated or cancelled;   \\n\\n   \\n\\nb. A Late Payment Fee is based on your Account balance contained on your most recent \\n\\nstatement if you have not made the required monthly payment by the statement due date. The \\n\\nlate payment fee will be up to $15 for balances up to $99.99, $25 for balances $100 to $999.99 \\n\\nand $35 for balances $1,000 or more, except that the fee will not exceed the minimum \\n\\npayment due when the payment was late and will exceed $25 only if more than one payment is \\n\\nlate within six billing cycles;   \\n\\n   \\n\\nc. A Transaction Fee for each Advance, including Balance Transfers and Quasi Cash Advances;   \\n\\n   \\n\\nd. A Returned Payment Fee for any payment that is returned unpaid by your financial institution, \\n\\nnot to exceed the minimum payment due when the payment was returned;   \\n\\n   \\n\\ne. An International Transaction Fee for each transaction made outside the U.S., including returns;   \\n\\n   \\n\\nf. A Copy Fee for each additional copy of a monthly statement or sales receipt we provide at your \\n\\nrequest; and   \\n\\n   \\n\\ng. A Rush Card Fee for each card you request be rush mailed to you within one business day if \\n\\nrequested before 1PM CST.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nThe specific amounts of these fees and any additional terms or conditions related to these fees are \\n\\nshown on the Account Disclosures Insert.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nINTEREST.  The monthly periodic rates used to calculate interest on your Account and the \\n\\ncorresponding Annual Percentage Rate (“APRs”) are set forth on the Account Disclosures Insert.  \\n\\nThe monthly periodic rates and corresponding APRs for each billing period will vary with the market \\n\\nbased on the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the last business day of the \\n\\n\\n\\n55793   \\n\\n   \\n\\npreceding month (the “Prime Rate”).  Your monthly periodic rates and corresponding APRs may \\n\\nincrease or decrease if the Prime Rate changes.  Changes in the Prime Rate will apply to your entire \\n\\nAccount balance and will apply to the first billing period that includes the first business day of the \\n\\nsecond month following the change, for example, if the Prime Rate changes on September 28, and \\n\\nyour billing period begins on the 15th of each month, the new rate will apply to the billing period that \\n\\nbegins October 15 because that billing period includes November 1 (assuming November 1 is a \\n\\nbusiness day). Changes in the Prime Rate may result in increases or decreases in the amount of \\n\\ninterest, minimum payments and/or number of payments.  A business day is any calendar day other \\n\\nthan a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday.  We may select a new interest rate index if the Prime \\n\\nRate is not available.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n1. Rate for Purchases.  The monthly periodic rate for a billing period for your Purchase balance is \\n\\nthe Prime Rate plus a Margin (set forth on the Account Disclosures Insert), divided by 12 and \\n\\ncalculated to three decimal places and rounded up.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n2. Rate for Advances.  The monthly periodic rate for a billing period for your Advance and Quasi \\n\\nCash Advance, balance is the Prime Rate plus a Margin (set forth on the Account Disclosures Insert), \\n\\ndivided by 12 and calculated to three decimal places and rounded up.   \\n\\n      \\n\\n3. Rate for Balance Transfers. The monthly periodic rate for a billing period for your Balance \\n\\nTransfer balance is the Prime Rate plus a Margin (set forth on the Account Disclosures Insert), \\n\\ndivided by 12 and calculated to three decimal places and rounded up.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nBALANCE SUBJECT TO INTEREST.  We figure the interest on your Account by applying the \\n\\napplicable monthly periodic rate to the “average daily balance” of your Account (including current \\n\\ntransactions).  To get the “average daily balance,” we take the beginning balance of your Account \\n\\neach day, add any new Purchases, Advances, and Quasi Cash Advance, Balance Transfers or fees, \\n\\nand subtract any payments and credits and unpaid interest.  This gives us the daily balance.  Then, \\n\\nwe add up the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the \\n\\nbilling period.  This gives us the “average daily balance.”     \\n\\n   \\n\\nWHEN INTEREST BEGINS TO ACCRUE; GRACE PERIOD.  Except as provided below, Purchases, \\n\\nAdvances and Quasi Cash Advance, and Balance Transfers begin to accrue interest from the date of \\n\\nthe transaction (or, at our option, from the date they are posted to your Account) and continue to \\n\\naccrue interest until the charge is paid in full.  You will have at least a 25 day grace period (“Grace \\n\\nPeriod”) on Purchases.  This means you have at least 25 days from the closing date on your monthly \\n\\nstatement to pay for new Purchases before we charge interest on them.  However, the Grace Period \\n\\nwill apply only in billing periods when (1) you paid the previous balance in full or (2) you had a \\n\\nprevious balance of $0.00 or a credit balance.  (The previous balance is the balance identified as the \\n\\nNew Balance on the monthly statement for the previous billing period.)  When the Grace Period \\n\\napplies, we will not impose interest on (1) any new Purchases if we receive the full New Balance on \\n\\nthe monthly statement for that billing period by the due date shown on that statement or (2) the \\n\\nportion of the Purchase balance repaid if we receive only part of the New Balance by the due date.  \\n\\nThere is no Grace Period within which you can avoid interest on Advances, Quasi Cash \\n\\nAdvance or Balance Transfers.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n55793   \\n\\n   \\n\\nAUTHORIZATION OF TRANSACTIONS; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  We are not obligated to \\n\\nauthorize any transaction (including Purchases, Advances, Quasi Cash Advance or Balance \\n\\nTransfers) under the following circumstances or any other circumstances which we deem necessary:  \\n\\n(1) your Credit Limit has been exceeded or would be exceeded by the transaction; (2) you have failed \\n\\nto pay amounts owed to us when due or have failed to follow any terms of this Agreement;   \\n\\n(3) you have notified us promptly that your Card or Credit Checks have been lost or stolen or may be \\n\\nused by an unauthorized person; (4) your Account has been closed for any reason; or (5) your rights \\n\\nunder this Agreement have expired or been revoked for any reason.  If, in our sole discretion, we \\n\\nelect to honor a transaction under any of the above circumstances, we may nevertheless charge the \\n\\nfull amount thereof to your Account.  We are not responsible for the failure of any merchant, financial \\n\\ninstitution or other party to honor your Card, Balance Transfer,  Advance or Quasi Cash Advance \\n\\nrequest.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nFOREIGN TRANSACTIONS.  The credit card association will convert any transaction in foreign \\n\\ncurrency into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate for the applicable central processing date that is (1) \\n\\nselected by the association from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets, which \\n\\nrate may vary from the rate the association receives, or (2) the government mandated rate.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nMILITARY LENDING ACT.  Federal law provides important protections to members of the Armed \\nForces and their dependents relating to extensions of consumer credit.  In general, the cost of consumer \\ncredit to a member of the Armed Forces and his or her dependent may not exceed an annual \\npercentage rate of 36 percent.  This rate must include, as applicable to the credit transaction or account: \\nThe costs associated with credit insurance premiums; fees for ancillary products sold in connection with \\nthe credit transaction; any application fee charged (other than certain application fees for specified \\ncredit transactions or accounts); and any participation fee charged (other than certain participation fees \\nfor a credit card account).  You can also call (844) 334-3810 to hear this disclosure orally.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nDEFAULT.  Subject to limitations required by applicable law, you will be in default if (1) you fail to pay \\n\\nthe full minimum payment on time; (2) you file for bankruptcy; (3) you break one of your promises \\n\\nunder this Agreement; (4) you provide us with any false, misleading, incomplete or incorrect \\n\\ninformation or signature; or (5) you die.  Upon your default, we may, subject to the limitations of \\n\\napplicable law and without notice: (1) reduce your Credit Limit; (2) close your Account and demand \\n\\nimmediate payment of the entire outstanding balance and any other fees or charges that may be \\n\\nimposed under the terms of this Agreement; (3) bring an action to collect all amounts owed; and/or (4) \\n\\ntake any action allowed by law.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nCOLLECTION COSTS.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to pay all costs and \\n\\ndisbursements, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by us in collecting or enforcing your \\n\\nindebtedness, whether or not a court proceeding is actually commenced.  We will bill these costs to \\n\\nyour Account as Purchases.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nOTHERS USING YOUR ACCOUNT.  You promise to pay for all transactions made by any other \\n\\nperson you authorize to use your Account, whether or not that person exceeded your permission and \\n\\nwhether or not you notified us that the person was using your Account.  If someone else is authorized \\n\\nto use your Card or Account and you want to end that person's privileges, you must let us know in \\n\\nwriting.  If he or she has a Card, you must return that Card cut in half with your written notice.   \\n\\n\\n\\n55793   \\n\\n   \\n\\nCLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT. You may close your Account at any time by notifying us in writing and \\n\\nreturning your Card(s) cut in half. You remain responsible to pay the amount you owe us according to \\n\\nthe terms of this Agreement. We may close or suspend your Account privileges at any time and \\n\\nwithout prior notice, unless required by applicable law, for any reason we deem appropriate, including \\n\\nif you are in default under this Agreement. We may also reissue a different Card at any time. Upon \\n\\nrequest, you must destroy the Card by cutting it in half and surrendering it to us or our agent. In the \\n\\nevent of the death of an existing Cardmember it is our policy to remove the Cardmember from the \\n\\nAccount and request that the decedent’s Card be destroyed.    \\n\\n \\n\\nADDRESSES; CHANGE OF ADDRESS.  Your full name, address and any signature on your  \\n\\nApplication are considered part of this Agreement.  For purposes of this Agreement, you agree and \\n\\nrepresent that you live at the address shown on your Application or from time to time designated by \\n\\nyou for the receipt of monthly statements.  You will notify us of any address change in writing before \\n\\nthe change becomes effective.   \\n\\nDELAY IN ENFORCEMENT; NO WAIVER BY US.  We can delay enforcing or waive any of our rights \\n\\nunder this Agreement without losing them.  If we waive a right, we do not thereby waive the same \\n\\nright in other situations.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nASSIGNMENT.  We can assign your Account and any of our rights under this Agreement without \\n\\nconsent or notice to you.

Box A3979   \\n\\nChicago, Illinois 60690   \\n\\nDate: July 1, 2018   \\n\\n   \\n\\nYour Billing Rights: Keep This Document For Future Use   \\n\\n   \\n\\n This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nWhat to Do If You Find a Mistake on Your Statement   \\n\\n   \\n\\n If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at Amalgamated Bank of Chicago, P.O. \\n\\nBox A3979, Chicago, Illinois 60690.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n  In your letter, give us the following information:   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* Account information: Your name and account number.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is \\n\\nwrong and why you believe it is a mistake.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n   You must contact us:   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop \\n\\npayment on the amount you think is wrong.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n   You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not \\n\\nrequired to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nWhat Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter   \\n\\n   \\n\\n  When we receive your letter, we must do two things:   \\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n55793   \\n\\n   \\n\\n1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will \\n\\nalso tell you if we have already corrected the error.    \\n\\n   \\n\\n2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why \\n\\nwe believe the bill is correct.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nWhile we investigate whether or not there has been an error:   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* We cannot try to collect any amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.    \\n\\n   \\n\\n* The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you \\n\\ninterest on that amount.    \\n\\n   \\n\\n* While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of \\n\\nyour balance.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nAfter we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other \\n\\nfees related to that amount.    \\n\\n   \\n\\n* If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along \\n\\nwith applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount that you owe \\n\\nand the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the \\n\\namount we think you owe.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n   If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 \\n\\ndays telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without \\n\\nalso reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we \\n\\nreported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been \\n\\nsettled between us.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nIf we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the amount you question, \\n\\neven if your bill is correct.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nYour Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases   \\n\\n   \\n\\n   If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, \\n\\nand you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not \\n\\nto pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.    \\n\\n   \\n\\n  To use this right, all of the following must be true:   \\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n55793   \\n\\n   \\n\\n1. The purchase must have made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing \\n\\naddress, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are \\n\\nnecessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the \\n\\ncompany that sold you the goods or services.)   \\n\\n   \\n\\n2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances \\n\\nfrom an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing \\n\\nat:      \\n\\n        Amalgamated Bank of Chicago   \\n\\n   P.O. Box A3979   \\n\\n     Chicago, Illinois 60690   \\n\\n   \\n\\n While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we \\nfinish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and \\nyou do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.   \\n\\n   \\nABOC Platinum Rewards Credit Card Application Disclosures   \\n\\nThese Account Disclosures are part of your Amalgamated Bank Credit Card Cardmember Agreement and contain important \\n\\ninformation about current rates and fees applicable to your Account.

OCTOBER 2018.2 Amalgamated Bank Credit \\n\\nCard  Cardmember Agreement   \\n\\n   \\n\\nRETAIL INSTALMENT CREDIT AGREEMENT   \\n\\n   \\n\\nAGREEMENT TERMS.  In this Agreement, the word “Cardmember” means any person who applied \\n\\nand was approved for a Card.  The words “you,” “your” and “yours” mean the Cardmember.  If you \\n\\nhave a Union Credit Card, the word “Union” means the union of which the Cardmember is a member \\n\\nin good standing.  The words “we,” “us,” “our,” “ours” and “Bank” mean Amalgamated Bank of \\n\\nChicago and its successors or assigns.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nCHANGING THIS AGREEMENT.  Subject to the limitations of applicable law, we may at any time \\n\\nchange, add to or delete any of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, including, but not limited \\n\\nto, interest rates and fees and this Changing This Agreement section.  Such changes may be based, \\n\\nin whole or in part, upon factors including, but not limited to, antifraud policies and procedures, your \\n\\nrecord of making timely payments and staying within the established Credit Limit on your Account \\n\\nwith us, or your credit score and information contained in your credit report.  We will give you notice of \\n\\nany change, addition or deletion as required by applicable law.  As of the effective date, the changed \\n\\nterms, at our option, will apply to new Purchases, Advances and Balance Transfers and to the \\n\\noutstanding balances of your Account, to the extent permitted by applicable law.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nCREDIT LIMIT.  We will grant you credit up to a maximum amount (your “Credit Limit”).  You will be \\n\\ninformed of your initial Credit Limit when you receive your Card.  Your current Credit Limit will be \\n\\nshown on each monthly statement.  You promise not to exceed your Credit Limit.  However, if you \\n\\nexceed your Credit Limit, we can still charge you for all Purchases, Advances, Balance Transfers, \\n\\ninterest and fees without giving up any of our rights.  At our discretion, we may change your Credit \\n\\nLimit at any time without advance notice to you.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nUSE OF ACCOUNT.  You may use your Account to make Purchases, Advances and Balance  \\n\\nTransfers as described below.  Any use of your Account number will be considered to be a use of the \\n\\nCard.  Please sign the Card before you use it.  The Card is our property.  You must return it to us or \\n\\nour agent upon request.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n1. Purchases.  You may use your Card at participating merchants to purchase goods and \\n\\nservices (“Purchases”).  Unless a billing error has been disclosed in your monthly statement, \\n\\nyour account may be debited as a purchase for each copy requested by you of a sale, refund \\n\\nor cash advance slip.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n2. Advances.  You may use your Card or Account to obtain cash loans (“Advances”) from an \\n\\nauthorized automated teller machine (“ATM”), bank or others who agree to accept your Card.  \\n\\nTo obtain Advances at authorized ATMs, you must request and use a personal identification \\n\\nnumber (“PIN”).  You agree to keep your PIN confidential and not write it on or leave it near \\n\\nyour Card.  ATM Cash Advance charges are shown on the Account Disclosures Insert and \\n\\nalso are available upon request.  We may impose other or different charges for Cash \\n\\nAdvances upon prior notice to you.  ATM Cash Advance Limits are shown on the monthly \\n\\nstatement as “Available Cash.”  We may change the Available Cash amount from time to time.     \\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n55795   \\n\\nYou also may obtain Advances by using Credit Checks that we may provide from time to time that \\n\\nyou may use like a personal check to access your Account.  Whenever you use a Credit Check, it will \\n\\nbe charged against your Account as an Advance on the date it is received by us.  You may not use \\n\\nyour Credit Checks as payment on your Account or any other account you have with us.  Credit \\n\\nChecks will not be returned with your monthly statement but will be identified on it.  We will not certify \\n\\na Credit Check.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n3. Balance Transfers.  You may use your Card or Account to transfer balances from other credit \\n\\ncard accounts to this Account (“Balance Transfers”) by means (including balance transfer \\n\\nforms) we may make available from time to time. You may not transfer balances from any \\n\\nother account you have with us.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nPROMISE TO PAY.  When you use your Account or permit someone else to use it, you promise to \\n\\npay the total amount of all Purchases, Advances and Balance Transfers as well as any interest or \\n\\nfees that may be due under the terms of this Agreement.  If your Account is a joint Account, all of you \\n\\nare bound by this Agreement and each of you jointly and individually promises to pay all amounts \\n\\nowed to us for transactions made by any joint Account holder.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nMONTHLY STATEMENT.  We will send you a monthly statement for any billing period in which there \\n\\nis activity on your Account, or as otherwise required by applicable law.  Your monthly statement will \\n\\nshow, among other things, (1) the unpaid balance on your Account at the beginning of the billing \\n\\nperiod (the “New Balance”); (2) any Purchases, Advances, Balance Transfers, interest, fees and \\n\\nother debits posted to your Account in that billing period; (3) any payments and credits posted to your \\n\\nAccount in that billing period; and (4) the minimum payment you must pay and the date your minimum \\n\\npayment is due (approximately 25 days after the billing date on your monthly statement).  We will \\n\\nsend the monthly statement to the address specified on your Application or to the address you \\n\\ndesignate from time to time.  If this is a joint Account, each of you appoints the other as his or her \\n\\nagent to designate the address to which we may send your monthly statements and any other \\n\\nnotices.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nPAYMENTS.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n1. Minimum Payment; Application of Payments.  You must pay at least the minimum payment \\n\\nshown on your monthly statement each billing period.  If the New Balance is more than $15, the \\n\\nminimum payment is $15 or 2.5% of the New Balance, whichever is greater.  The minimum payment \\n\\nwill be rounded up to the nearest dollar.  If the New Balance is less than $15, the total New Balance is \\n\\ndue.  Any amounts past due or in excess of your Credit Limit will also be added to the minimum \\n\\npayment.  Payment for more than the minimum amount due will be accepted as a single payment for \\n\\nthat month.  Any amount over the minimum is not applicable to future amounts due.  In accordance \\n\\nwith applicable law, we will choose the order in which payments are applied to your Account.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n2. Skip Payment Options (If You Have A Union Credit Card).  We may allow you to skip one or \\n\\nmore minimum payments if one of the following options is applicable to your Account.  Interest will \\n\\ncontinue to accrue on any unpaid balance in any billing period in which you skip a minimum payment, \\n\\nbut no Late Payment Fee will be imposed on your Account.  An election to skip payments under \\n\\neither option may lengthen the period over which your Account balance must be paid.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n55795   \\n\\na. Strike Skip Payment:  You may skip the minimum payment for those months when you \\n\\nare on strike if (1) the strike lasts for at least 30 days and is sanctioned by your Union \\n\\nand (2) your Union notifies us that you qualify for the Strike Skip Payment.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nb. “No-Pay” Option Months:  If your Union has chosen “no-pay” option months, you may \\n\\nskip the minimum payment in those months.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n3. Making Payments.  All payments must be in U.S. dollars.  All checks must be drawn on funds \\n\\non deposit in the United States.  Mail your payment to the address shown on your monthly statement.  \\n\\nYour payment will be credited as of the date of receipt by us only if received by 5:00 p.m. (Central \\n\\nStandard Time).  Any payments received after this time will be deemed received by us on the next \\n\\nbusiness day.  Payments made at any location other than the address shown on your monthly \\n\\nstatement could be subject to a delay in crediting.  With your payment, include your payment coupon, \\n\\nwhich is a portion of your monthly statement.  If you do not include your payment coupon, credit to \\n\\nyour Account may be delayed.  Delayed crediting may cause you to incur a Late Payment Fee or \\n\\nadditional interest.  Payments can also be made online at www.aboc.com or by phone at (800) 365-\\n\\n6464. Do not send us cash.     \\n\\n   \\n\\n4. Disputed Payments.  You agree not to send us payments marked “paid in full,” “without \\n\\nrecourse” or with similar language.  If you send such a payment, we may accept it without losing any \\n\\nof our rights under this Agreement.  All written communications concerning disputed amounts, \\n\\nincluding any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes “payment \\n\\nin full” of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction \\n\\nof a disputed amount, must be mailed or delivered to Amalgamated Bank of Chicago, P.O. Box \\n\\nA3979, Chicago, Illinois 60690 Attn: Credit Card Disputed Payments.  You may also dispute payment \\n\\nby visiting our Online Banking website and searching for the transaction in question.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nOTHER FEES.  Subject to limitations and requirements of applicable law, you agree to pay the \\n\\nfollowing fees:   \\n\\n   \\n\\na. If applicable, an Annual Fee, which will be billed on your first monthly statement and thereafter \\n\\non the anniversary date of your Account until your Account is terminated or cancelled;   \\n\\n   \\n\\nb. A Late Payment Fee is based on your Account balance contained on your most recent \\n\\nstatement if you have not made the required monthly payment by the statement due date. The \\n\\nlate payment fee will be up to $15 for balances up to $99.99, $25 for balances $100 to $999.99 \\n\\nand $35 for balances $1,000 or more, except that the fee will not exceed the minimum \\n\\npayment due when the payment was late and will exceed $25 only if more than one payment is \\n\\nlate within six billing cycles;   \\n\\n   \\n\\nc. A Transaction Fee for each Advance, including Balance Transfers;   \\n\\n   \\n\\nd. A Returned Payment Fee for any payment that is returned unpaid by your financial institution, \\n\\nnot to exceed the minimum payment due when the payment was returned;   \\n\\n   \\n\\ne. An International Transaction Fee for each transaction made outside the U.S., including returns;   \\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n55795   \\n\\nf. A Copy Fee for each additional copy of a monthly statement or sales receipt we provide at your \\n\\nrequest; and   \\n\\n   \\n\\ng. A Rush Card Fee for each card you request be rush mailed to you within one business day if \\n\\nrequested before 1PM CST.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nThe specific amounts of these fees and any additional terms or conditions related to these fees are \\n\\nshown on the Account Disclosures Insert.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nINTEREST.  The monthly periodic rates used to calculate interest on your Account and the \\n\\ncorresponding Annual Percentage Rate (“APRs”), which depend on the type of Card you have (such \\n\\nas Union, Standard or Gold), are set forth on the Account Disclosures Insert.  The monthly periodic \\n\\nrates and corresponding APRs for each billing period will vary with the market based on the prime \\n\\nrate published in The Wall Street Journal on the last business day of the preceding month (the “Prime \\n\\nRate”).  Your monthly periodic rates and corresponding APRs may increase or decrease if the Prime \\n\\nRate changes.  Changes in the Prime Rate will apply to your entire Account balance and will apply to \\n\\nthe first billing period that includes the first business day of the second month following the change, \\n\\nfor example, if the Prime Rate changes on September 28, and your billing period begins on the 15th of \\n\\neach month, the new rate will apply to the billing period that begins October 15 because that billing \\n\\nperiod includes November 1 (assuming November 1 is a business day). Changes in the Prime Rate \\n\\nmay result in increases or decreases in the amount of interest, minimum payments and/or number of \\n\\npayments.  A business day is any calendar day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday.  \\n\\nWe may select a new interest rate index if the Prime Rate is not available.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n1. Rate for Purchases.  The monthly periodic rate for a billing period for your Purchase balance \\nis the Prime Rate plus a Margin (set forth on the Account Disclosures Insert), divided by 12 and \\n\\ncalculated to three decimal places and rounded up.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n2. Rate for Advances.  The monthly periodic rate for a billing period for your Advance balance is \\nthe Prime Rate plus a Margin (set forth on the Account Disclosures Insert), divided by 12 and \\n\\ncalculated to three decimal places and rounded up.   \\n      \\n\\n3. Rate for Balance Transfers. The monthly periodic rate for a billing period for your Balance \\nTransfer balance is the Prime Rate plus a Margin (set forth on the Account Disclosures Insert), divided \\n\\nby 12 and calculated to three decimal places and rounded up.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nBALANCE SUBJECT TO INTEREST.  We figure the interest on your Account by applying the \\n\\napplicable monthly periodic rate to the “average daily balance” of your Account (including current \\n\\ntransactions).  To get the “average daily balance,” we take the beginning balance of your Account \\n\\neach day, add any new Purchases, Advances, Balance Transfers or fees, and subtract any payments \\n\\nand credits and unpaid interest.  This gives us the daily balance.  Then, we add up the daily balances \\n\\nfor the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period.  This gives us the \\n\\n“average daily balance.”     \\n\\n   \\n\\nWHEN INTEREST BEGINS TO ACCRUE; GRACE PERIOD.  Except as provided below, Purchases, \\n\\nAdvances and Balance Transfers begin to accrue interest from the date of the transaction (or, at our \\n\\noption, from the date they are posted to your Account) and continue to accrue interest until the charge \\n\\nis paid in full.  You will have at least a 25 day grace period (“Grace Period”) on Purchases.  This \\n\\nmeans you have at least 25 days from the closing date on your monthly statement to pay for new \\n\\n\\n\\n55795   \\n\\nPurchases before we charge interest on them.  However, the Grace Period will apply only in billing \\n\\nperiods when (1) you paid the previous balance in full or (2) you had a previous balance of $0.00 or a \\n\\ncredit balance.  (The previous balance is the balance identified as the New Balance on the monthly \\n\\nstatement for the previous billing period.)  When the Grace Period applies, we will not impose interest \\n\\non (1) any new Purchases if we receive the full New Balance on the monthly statement for that billing \\n\\nperiod by the due date shown on that statement or (2) the portion of the Purchase balance repaid if \\n\\nwe receive only part of the New Balance by the due date.  There is no Grace Period within which \\n\\nyou can avoid interest on Advances or Balance Transfers.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nAUTHORIZATION OF TRANSACTIONS; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  We are not obligated to \\n\\nauthorize any transaction (including Purchases, Advances, Balance Transfers or Credit Checks) \\n\\nunder the following circumstances or any other circumstances which we deem necessary: (1) \\n\\nyour Credit Limit has been exceeded or would be exceeded by the  transaction; (2) you have \\n\\nfailed to pay amounts owed to us when due or have failed to follow any terms of this Agreement; \\n\\n(3) you have notified us promptly that your Card or Credit Checks have been lost or stolen or may \\n\\nbe used by an unauthorized person; (4) your Account has been closed for any reason; or (5) your \\n\\nrights under this Agreement have expired or been revoked for any reason.  If, in our sole \\n\\ndiscretion, we elect to honor a transaction under any of the above circumstances, we may \\n\\nnevertheless charge the full amount thereof to your Account.  We are not responsible for the \\n\\nfailure of any merchant, financial institution or other party to honor your Card or Advance request.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nFOREIGN TRANSACTIONS.  The credit card association will convert any transaction in foreign \\n\\ncurrency into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate for the applicable central processing date that is (1) \\n\\nselected by the association from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets, which \\n\\nrate may vary from the rate the association receives, or (2) the government mandated rate.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nMILITARY LENDING ACT.  Federal law provides important protections to members of the Armed \\nForces and their dependents relating to extensions of consumer credit.  In general, the cost of consumer \\ncredit to a member of the Armed Forces and his or her dependent may not exceed an annual \\npercentage rate of 36 percent.  This rate must include, as applicable to the credit transaction or account: \\nThe costs associated with credit insurance premiums; fees for ancillary products sold in connection \\nwith the credit transaction; any application fee charged (other than certain application fees for specified \\ncredit transactions or accounts); and any participation fee charged (other than certain participation fees \\n\\nfor a credit card account).

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to pay all costs and \\n\\ndisbursements, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by us in collecting or enforcing your \\n\\nindebtedness, whether or not a court proceeding is actually commenced.  We will bill these costs to \\n\\nyour Account as Purchases.   \\n\\n\\n\\n55795   \\n\\n   \\n\\nOTHERS USING YOUR ACCOUNT.  You promise to pay for all transactions made by any other \\n\\nperson you authorize to use your Account, whether or not that person exceeded your permission and \\n\\nwhether or not you notified us that the person was using your Account.  If someone else is authorized \\n\\nto use your Card or Account and you want to end that person's privileges, you must let us know in \\n\\nwriting.  If he or she has a Card, you must return that Card cut in half with your written notice.   \\n\\nCLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT. You may close your Account at any time by notifying us in writing and \\n\\nreturning your Card(s) cut in half. You remain responsible to pay the amount you owe us according to \\n\\nthe terms of this Agreement.

We may also reissue a different Card at any time. Upon \\n\\nrequest, you must destroy the Card by cutting it in half and surrendering it to us or our agent. In the \\n\\nevent of the death of an existing Cardmember it is our policy to remove the  \\n\\nCardmember from the Account and request that the decedent’s Card be destroyed. If the Account is \\n\\njointly held we will evaluate various factors relating to the remaining Cardmember to determine if the \\n\\nCredit Limit should be adjusted as described in the section of this Agreement entitled “Credit Limit” \\n\\nand “Default”.   \\n\\nADDRESSES; CHANGE OF ADDRESS.

Box A3979, Chicago, Illinois 60690.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n  In your letter, give us the following information:   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* Account information: Your name and account number.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is \\n\\nwrong and why you believe it is a mistake.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n   You must contact us:   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop \\n\\npayment on the amount you think is wrong.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n   You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not \\n\\nrequired to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nWhat Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter   \\n\\n   \\n\\nWhen we receive your letter, we must do two things:   \\n\\n   \\n\\n1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will \\n\\nalso tell you if we have already corrected the error.    \\n\\n\\n\\n55795   \\n\\n   \\n\\n2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why \\n\\nwe believe the bill is correct.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nWhile we investigate whether or not there has been an error:   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* We cannot try to collect any amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.    \\n\\n   \\n\\n* The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you \\n\\ninterest on that amount.    \\n\\n   \\n\\n* While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of \\n\\nyour balance.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nAfter we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:   \\n\\n   \\n\\n* If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other \\n\\nfees related to that amount.    \\n\\n   \\n\\n* If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along \\n\\nwith applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount that you owe \\n\\nand the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the \\n\\namount we think you owe.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n   If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 \\n\\ndays telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without \\n\\nalso reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we \\n\\nreported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been \\n\\nsettled between us.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n   If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the amount you question, \\n\\neven if your bill is correct.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nYour Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases   \\n\\n   \\n\\n   If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, \\n\\nand you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not \\n\\nto pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.    \\n\\n   \\n\\n  To use this right, all of the following must be true:   \\n\\n   \\n\\n1. The purchase must have made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing \\n\\naddress, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are \\n\\nnecessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the \\n\\ncompany that sold you the goods or services.)   \\n\\n\\n\\n55795   \\n\\n   \\n\\n2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances \\n\\nfrom an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing \\n\\nat:      \\n\\n   Amalgamated Bank of Chicago   \\n\\n      P.O. Box A3979   \\n\\n      Chicago, Illinois 60690   \\n\\n   \\n\\n While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we \\nfinish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and \\n\\nyou do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.   \\n\\n   \\n\\nAmalgamated Bank Credit Card Account Disclosures   \\nThese Account Disclosures are part of your Amalgamated Bank Credit Card Cardmember Agreement and contain important information about current \\n\\nrates and fees applicable to your Account.   \\nPlease keep this copy for your records.
